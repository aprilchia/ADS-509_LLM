1qd7x1u,TheMainShy,"**disclaimer: I'm recounting what was said on the livestream over the past couple of hours. This is not an official statement nor a full investigation. This is all preliminary and ongoing.** 

I'm watching the livestream on YouTube. There's a reporter on the ground asking witnesses what happened and is trying to gather info during the chaos. From what I'm understanding, a bunch of ICE agents were conducting door-to-door knocks and sweeps. They surrounded a pregnant woman at her home. She was worried she was going to go into labor. Community members began to show up and try to protect her. The pregnant woman may have had another child near her, either her own child or a neighborhood child. There was shouting and the woman's husband (or a male friend) tried to help protect the pregnant woman and the agent shot him in the leg, as the man, potentially his pregnant wife, and the child retreated either into their homes or their neighbors'. We don't know if the child or pregnant woman was shot, but apparently the man got shot in the leg. The police and ICE are currently surrounding the house to try and get them out. ICE is also deploying chemical agents into the crowd, which includes neighbors, community watchers, and press. That's what I've gathered so far, but more information will come out eventually. The DHS statement and the on the ground coverage and witnesses statements will probably differ. Take everything with a grain until all the facts arrive. This all could be completely incorrect, so please wait for more information. Everything is currently still in the heat of the moment.

1qd7ny5,B-Z_B-S,"(From the article) ""Three more Democratic lawmakers said on Wednesday that they were being investigated for their participation in a video urging military service members to resist illegal orders.

Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania all reported that they had received inquiries from Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a longtime ally of President Trump, requesting an interview with them or their private counsel. The disclosures follow a [similar one](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/us/politics/slotkin-pirro-trump-justice-dept-video.html) this week by Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.

Mr. Trump and other administration officials have described the video, which restates a fundamental principle of military law, as “seditious.” But it is unclear what possible crime the lawmakers are believed to have committed.

The investigations are the latest escalation in a campaign by Mr. Trump and his allies to exact retribution on those he views as enemies. They also add to a growing list of high-profile targets who have clashed with Mr. Trump and are now being investigated by Ms. Pirro’s office, including the [Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/jerome-powell-fed-inquiry-trump.html).

A spokesman for Ms. Pirro’s office on Wednesday declined to confirm or deny any investigation.

Ms. Slotkin, who organized the video, served three tours in Iraq with the C.I.A. The other five members who appeared in the video, which was released in November, all served in the U.S. military. All six lawmakers also said they had received an inquiry from the F.B.I.’s counterterrorism division late last year.

Mr. Crow, who served as an Army Ranger and led troops in combat, [accused](https://x.com/RepJasonCrow/status/2011559718352011391?s=20) Mr. Trump in a video post to social media of “using his political cronies in the Department of Justice to continue to threaten and intimidate us.”

Ms. Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, [said](https://x.com/RepHoulahan/status/2011548706185544133?s=20) on social media that she and her colleagues were being targeted because they had said something that Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “didn’t want anyone to hear.”

Ms. Goodlander, in a social media post, called the Trump administration’s response “sad and telling.”

“These threats will not deter, distract, intimidate, or silence me,” she added.

In a video released on Wednesday, Ms. Slotkin disparaged the investigation and Mr. Trump’s attacks on her and her colleagues as “legal intimidation and physical intimidation meant to get you to shut up.” But she vowed that they would not work.

Right now, speaking out against the abuse of power is the most patriotic thing we can do,” she said.

“These threats will not deter, distract, intimidate, or silence me,” Representative Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire said in a social media post.
Last week, Mr. Hegseth announced that the military had started administrative actions against Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona and a retired Navy captain, who also participated in the video. The proceedings could result in a reduction in his rank and military pension.
As a retired naval officer, Mr. Kelly, who flew 39 combat missions as a naval aviator and four spaceflights as an astronaut, is subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and therefore can be recalled to active duty and disciplined. The other Democratic lawmakers in the video did not serve long enough to retire and do not receive a pension or fall under military law.

1qd7lnq,toomuchtodotoday,"&gt; so if you shoot you’re not coming out alive.

Potentially better than not coming out alive without having attempted to defend yourself. Might as well take the chance to defend yourself, along with a jury trial that will potentially nullify (less than 50% of Americans support these actions, in a blue state or city should be trivial to get a jury that will deadlock or acquit for self defense). There are only 20k-30k ICE agents total in the US at the moment. That's less than total NYC police force (~34k-36k). Population of Minneapolis is ~420k. 

Best of luck to the gravy seals as long as the second amendment exists (and 47 states permit some form of open carry), especially when thousands of them are having their personal information leaked online (so far!). The US military went into Iraq and Afghanistan much more prepared and with more resources ($4T-$6T), [and still lost badly](https://www.fcnl.org/updates/2016-10/costs-war-numbers). ""Sucks to suck"" as the kids say.

TLDR There is no question there will continue to be civilian casualties from this administration's actions and directives, but due to actions so far, civilians are now highly motivated to enable their self defense at all costs based on the rules of engagement laid out thus far (where you could be killed and there will be zero repercussions for the person who committed the unlawful act). They might murder you just for saying something that rubs them the wrong way.

(and good luck sending the US military in! they have never been stretched more thin, if you can convince them to obey unlawful orders against US citizens: https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-u-s-cant-handle-a-war/ | https://www.gao.gov/military-readiness | https://www.businessinsider.com/military-recruiting-methods-outdated-teenage-population-shrinking-2026-1 | https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/03/07/army-losing-nearly-one-quarter-of-soldiers-first-2-years-of-enlistment.html)",2026-01-15 03:07:28

Qualified immunity was later [created by courts](https://www.ncsl.org/civil-and-criminal-justice/qualified-immunity?), not lawmakers, to protect officials who made reasonable mistakes in unclear situations. It was supposed to be [limited and practical.](https://eji.org/issues/qualified-immunity/?)

&gt;Over time, it grew into something else entirely.

&gt;Today, even when a court believes an officer used excessive force, the case can still be thrown out unless the victim can point to an earlier case with almost the exact same facts.

2. Eleminate and ban police unions. Unions are for workers who don't carry guns and contribute to society. 


3. Require police officers to carry malpractice insurance. The more they do wrong, the higher their premium. The better they do, the lower their premium becomes .


4. Require all police to attend 90 hours of de-escalation training  during initial training and 24 hours training every year. It should be the first thing in their toolbox, not a gun, not mace.

1qd67cr,Hrmbee,"A number of critical points:

&gt;The White House posted a cartoon to X on Wednesday of two Greenlandic mush teams with three huskies each, pointing towards the choice of the white pillars and the South Lawn or a tempestuous scene by the Great Wall of China and Red Square in Russia.
&gt;
&gt;Paired with the image, the official White House account posted a single question: “Which way, Greenland man?”
&gt;
&gt;At first glance, it might seem to be innocuous and referencing the ongoing demands of Donald Trump that Greenland – an official Danish territory – become part of the United States.
&gt;
&gt;But according to Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism who closely monitors American neo-Nazis, this was a clear cut example of a nod towards racist, far-right literature.
&gt;
&gt;“This is a key concept in neo-Nazi and white supremacist subculture,” said Beirich. “Western man is code for white man, and one of the most popular racist books in these subcultures is Which Way Western Man, which has been featured in a [Department of Homeland Security] post celebrating manifest destiny.”
&gt;
&gt;The 1978 book is essential reading among the American far right and was written by the late white nationalist William Gayley Simpson, a member of the National Alliance – a foundational neo-Nazi organization established by William Luther Pierce, whose writing inspired several acts of terrorism, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.
&gt;
&gt;“It’s absolutely shocking to see such images being deployed by this administration,” said Beirich. “The idea appeals to racists and white supremacists who think only white people should be in positions of power.”

No longer surprising from this administration, but it is deeply disturbing at how blatant this government is now about its conversion to an authoritarian white nationalist regime.

&gt;**Three months later**, Trump paid $90k for a full-page ad in the New York Times where he criticized the United States' support for NATO. He discusses it with Larry King on that same day in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8wJc7vHcTs).

&gt;When did the KGB open a file on Donald Trump?

&gt;We don’t know, but Eastern Bloc security service records suggest this may have been as early as 1977. That was the year when Trump married Ivana Zelnickova, a twenty-eight-year-old model from Czechoslovakia.

So, let's do some math, real math not MAGA math.

Their annual salary is $174,000/year x 218 Republicans (they are the majority meaning no bill passes unless they pass it) = $37,972,000 in pay per year.

wants and stay in power or do anything else and lose it. That’s the modern GOP. There is no room for disagreement or principles because if you exhibit either, you lose your job.

That is the entire reason Trump wasn’t successfully impeached after Jan 6. It’s the entire reason all these dangerous unqualified people were confirmed to his cabinet. It’s the entire reason for everything. They will not stand up to him if they want to remain in office. Ever. Very few of the people in the Senate or even in his fucking cabinet believe in a lot of this shit. They are just all self interested greedy fucks that have no principles and will say and do anything as long as
they get power. JD Vance is a glaring example of this.",2026-01-15 02:50:53

I understand this study is biased by people who were in Fetterman’s camp. They have ideas, and their ideas sound good on paper but miss the point, as does the general message of ‘defund ICE’.

At a fiscal level- yes. There was never a good or rational reason to give them more money than the Marines.

At a policy level, we need deep reform and strict guidelines. Even regular police, as bad as they can be, don’t operate like a damned rogue, occupying army harassing, attacking, killing, and terrorizing civilians. Whatever this is needs to be completely undone and replaced with something that, at the very minimum, respects ALL human dignity. Giving people foil blankets and telling them to sleep on a concrete floor does not respect human dignity. And we know, that’s but one instance of how inhumane this organization acts.

Some have lumped in DHS with this. Yes. Whatever the hell it’s become is far from helping Americans with anything useful or for the betterment of their lives.

You could come up with the best slogan in the world and the best solution in the world and they would attack it because they hate non-Republicans.

The origin of the phrase was unclear, but it did not appear to have been used by the Trump administration or other presidential administrations before appearing on the lectern. Online searches for the origin of the phrase returned only results for more social media posts claiming it had roots in the Nazi regime, without providing further evidence. Searches of newspaper archives also found no instances of the Trump administration or other governments using the specific phrase. 

&gt; Snopes reached out to Page Herrlinger, a professor of history and chair of the department of Russian, East European and Eurasian studies at Bowdoin College, to ask about the origin of the phrase ""one of ours, all of yours"" and any potential connections to the Nazis.

1qd4zuo,KrasnovPlaysTheHits,"&gt;His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time, and blame him for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough, people will sooner or later believe it.

-

&gt;A few years ago he appointed a committee to act as final judges on all matters of art, but when their verdicts did not please him he dismissed them and assumed their duties himself. It makes little difference whether the field be economics, education, foreign affairs, propaganda, movies, music or women's dress. In each and every field he believes himself to be an unquestioned authority.

-

&gt;He dislikes desk work and seldom glances at the piles of reports which are placed on his desk daily. No matter how important these may be or how much his adjutants may urge him to attend to the particular matter, he refuses to take them seriously unless it happens to be a project which interests him. 

-

&gt;""The only criterion for membership in the Party was that the applicant be 'Unconditionally obedient and faithfully devoted to me'. When someone asked if that applied to thieves and criminals, [he] said, 'Their private lives 
don't concern me.'""

-

&gt;His power and fascination in speaking lay almost wholly in his ability to sense what a given audience wanted to hear and then to ... ""act as a loudspeaker proclaiming the most secret desires, the least permissible instincts, the sufferings and personal revolts of a whole nation.""

-

&gt;On the whole, his speeches were sinfully long, badly structured and very repetitious. Some of them are positively painful to read but nevertheless, when he delivered them they had an extraordinary effect upon his audiences.

-

&gt;Equally important has been his ability to persuade others to repudiate their individual consciences and assume that role himself. He can then decree for the individual what is right and wrong, permissible or impermissible and can use them freely in the attainment of his own ends. As Goering has said: ""I have no conscience. My conscience is Adolph Hitler.""

-

&gt;The course he will follow will almost certainly be the one which seems to him to be the surest road to immortality and at the same time drag the world down in flames.

The point Childers made that stuck with me the most was that Hitler wasn't a particularly ideological person and would regularly just agree with or side with whomever happened to be in front of him so long as it benefitted him or they complimented him. There were documented cases where he would side with someone asking for favors in his office only to have them walk out and the next person walk in ask for an opposing request to which he would fervently agree. No policy, per se. Just one rule - blame 'them' for the wrongs of the world and make wins up to take credit for if you can't find any real ones. He was, without question, only for himself and the easiest path to favor/fame.

From the article:

U.S. Senate Republicans blocked a resolution on Wednesday that would have barred President Donald Trump from further military action in Venezuela without Congress' authorization, after the Republican president put pressure on party members who had supported it.

The vote was 51-50 for a Republican point of order to dismiss the war powers resolution, as just three of Trump's Republicans voted with every Democrat in favor of moving ahead and Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol to break the tie.

1qd4en9,KingFrenulitis,"So, I’m very anti MAGA. I’m also a physician. I’m also a bodybuilder (speaks to my interest and commitment to nutrition, that’s about it). 
There’s nothing wrong with whole milk. Especially, when you consider a significant percentage of our population’s children get the majority of their daily calories from food they eat at school. I was a fan of former 1st Lady Obama’s interest in improving our children’s nutrition status, but I never liked the execution. Excess calories aren’t coming from school. The amount of impoverished American children argues against a blanket move to limit calories. 

That said, I’m a scientist first and foremost. Any data anyone throws at me that’s supported by evidence and is reproducible will absolutely increase the likelihood I reverse my stance.

Like pizza and muffins weren't allowed among many others. It basically became impossible for some of the bigger athletes to actually reach the caloric and protein intake that they needed. 

And a lot of this is because diet can't be legislated like that because people's bodies are vastly different.

1qd4en9,KingFrenulitis,"This is true. But excluding rare genetic conditions, children aren’t dying from heart attacks or strokes. 

Most children aren’t having vascular events because of dietary fat consumption. An again, the rates of poverty in the country skew so far to the “just feed them, who cares with what” category that this concern is rendered fairly irrelevant. 

My feeling is as well-intentioned as this was, the more prudent and effective approach would’ve been to instead incorporate dedicated nutrition classes from kindergarten to high school graduation. Not news worthy, but I’ve found education to be far more effective at affecting lifestyle changes in patients than brute force.

It really is not worth it to run on abolish, even if you want to see ICE abolished. I mean, had more voted in the US in 2024, you'd have seen more Trump voters because we're currently in a period where the right wing is ""cool"" culturally. Once this cools off as a hot button topic, support for abolishing ICE will likely drop because right now it's the ""in"" thing to hate immigration.

That doesn't mean do nothing though. I'd replace abolish with revamp (the fact that training was dropped to ""47"" days is nuts and a sign of a big ego) and campaign on revamping the immigration system.",2026-01-15 01:18:33

They are equally as responsible for this shit. And every single American сunт not actively doing anything to stop Trump from going to bloody fucking war with his former Allies/Friends, every second latin America country and some place in the middle east, is also responsible for this.

But the good old question of how could the Germans have let it happen in 1933 ... as they have the same shit going on at their doorstep. I mean, the Americans literally already have their Gestapo in form of the ICE. 

Nothing is going to change till it properly escalates, nothing the American citizens are remotely willing to do will get rid of Trump and it sure doesn't look like any other higher power will do anything that's actually going to help. 

I blame the Americans for voting Trump into power, obviously this plays right into Putin's card's, but it wasn't him who got him there without some uninformed American сunт who can't even point at the map where Mexico is, voting him into power.",2026-01-15 01:00:49

1qd3lze,Gloomy_Nebula_5138,"I wonder what Trump said to pressure or intimidate or convince Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana to vote against this. I find this really disappointing because it seems really obvious that unilateral attacks against another country, without international support, are a bad idea. In this case, the administration lied to the American public about the motivation being drugs. It became obvious that this was about accessing Venezuela’s oil and minerals, and in particular, Trump / his friends / his family could use this as a corrupt way to enrich themselves. Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth also lied to Congress when they said there were no plans for a regime change two weeks before they performed a regime change. Articles have mentioned that the Trump administration had been working with Delcy Rodriguez for a year, which means they knew what they were orchestrating.

With all of these issues, it’s disappointing that GOP legislators cannot find the courage to stand up to the administration, defend the rule of law, and protect American legitimacy and reputation in the international community. It also seems like a bad idea for GOP legislators to remain silent and complicit, when [a majority of Americans polled say the administration has gone too far on foreign intervention](https://apnews.com/article/poll-trump-venezuela-foreign-policy-approval-ce8d92a1461abb354f8c799e6b487e49).

From the article:

&gt;The brutality Americans are witnessing from Immigration and Customs Enforcement is just the tip of the iceberg: the agency is reportedly running nearly two dozen secret operations to spy on all of us.

&gt;Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein [reported](https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/21-secret-ice-programs-revealed) Wednesday that he’d received a “sensitive” 15-page government document outlining 21 “major” ICE operations leaked by a concerned Border Patrol official. These operations, many of which had previously gone unreported, have resulted in 6,852 apprehensions since June, according to the document.

&gt;One document outlined a program called Operation Abracadaba, which is the process of interviewing 100 percent of detainees in order to identify follow-on targets such stash houses in order to “target transnational criminal corporations.”

&gt;A leaked slide explained Operation Abracadabra’s purpose as: “Tying every individual who crosses the border illegally to a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a Transnational Criminal Organization, and/or utilizing the intelligence to develop targets.”

&gt;Another program was Operation Benchwarmer, a plan to use plainclothes agents “embedded in transport vans, sally ports, processing areas, and detention cells” to secretly spy on immigrants who have been detained. That operation already includes 2,000 “intelligence assets” across the country.

&gt;Another “secret” program Klippenstein mentioned was Operation Tidal Wave, a state-wide operation in Florida that led to the arrests of 1,120 people, only [63 percent](https://newrepublic.com/post/195984/ice-arrested-1400-people-how-many-criminal-charges) of whom had a criminal record. Another, Operation Fleur De Lis, could potentially refer to an operation [in Louisiana](https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/new-orleans-sector-louisiana) where the Department of Homeland Security [deployed CBP agents](https://lailluminator.com/2025/11/18/border-patrol-new-orleans/) in November.

1qd2jy2,Oboro-kun,"I think this happens because once you explain trans people to children, several things follow naturally and they do not want that:

First, they attack trans people are an easy scapegoat for republicans and MAGA

Second, To a kid once you tell them about it, gender discrimination starts to look completely stupid and arbitrary (which it is, but its makes it even more plainly obvious)

And third, once you open the door to that topic, it is very natural to move into related conversations. Things like bodily autonomy, consent, and the idea that kids can express boundaries or make age appropriate choices about themselves.

Even when the explanation of trans people is completely innocent, it makes children more aware of these issues. And that awareness makes it much harder for predators to manipulate or abuse them.",2026-01-14 23:58:37
1qd2jy2,AgnesCarlos,"This. I never thought of it this way but hot damn, the systematic defunding of education in nothing short of grooming kids.",2026-01-15 00:55:14
1qd2jy2,Oboro-kun,"Yeah, it is easier to groom a child who has never been taught boundaries. But if you or I had a child and they met a trans person, it would probably just lead to normal questions. They might ask something like, “Why didn’t they transition earlier?” And you could answer with something simple and responsible, like, “Because important decisions like that require time. People wait until they are old enough to be sure and to decide for themselves, not on a whim.”

That could be the end of it. But once you are already there, it becomes very natural to expand the conversation. You can explain that, just like with transitioning, there are things kids should not be pressured into, especially by strangers. If someone tries to push them into doing something inappropriate, the answer is no, because they are not at an age where they can make those decisions. In that sense, trans people become a very natural and effective way to talk about boundaries, age limits, and consent, without fear or moral panic.


Then another question often follows. “If Tommy’s aunt can become his uncle, why do some people treat women as lesser?” At that point, gender discrimination starts to look completely absurd, which is it, but oddly enough most Transphobes think a Women place is in the Kitchen. If trans people were globally accepted, the logical conclusion would be that gender based discrimination makes no sense. Gender and sex still exist and have differences, of course, and gender identity matter , but the idea that half the population is inherently lesser collapses when people can consciously choose to live as a woman or a man. Differences exist, but none of them justify discrimination.


Also the is the small chance that very same child is transgender, so if they are informed they might puzzled out sooner instead of realising at their 20s and think ""nah its far too late for me"" so they instead choose to repress it, and that leads to less trans people out there and less of these entire conversations",2026-01-15 01:05:34
1qd2jy2,Acceptable_Cut_7545,"A lot of early sex education for kids is about teaching them about boundaries and healthy personal choices and what to do if someone crosses those boundaries.

1qd2jy2,Succubista,"I have always wondered why these people try and scapegoat minorities for the horrible things they're doing, when they could just sit quietly and try and draw less public attention to it overall.

This is the best explanation I've ever read.",2026-01-15 01:26:09
1qd2jy2,Oboro-kun,"I want to be clear that this is just my speculation. I fully believe there are people who simply hate trans people, whether due to misinformation, being influenced by others who are equally misinformed, deliberate manipulation of the narrative by politicians, or plain bigotry toward anything that is different.

Setting those people aside, I think predators, and certain conservative and religious groups in particular, have a unique problem with trans people because their existence dismantles many of their core worldviews. Not every conservative or religious person necessarily sees trans people as a major issue, but those who are also predators absolutely do. That is who I am focusing on here.

The existence of trans people completely undermines narratives that rely on rigid gender hierarchies. Many of these groups benefit from or openly promote the idea that men are superior to women. You have figures like Andrew Tate claiming women are essentially cattle, yet someone’s cousin willingly transitions from Thomas to Tamara. How can women be inferior or subservient if some men freely choose to live as women? And if women were truly lesser, why would people who accept trans people also accept trans men as equal to men? The entire framework collapses. While differences between sex and gender do exist, they are not meaningful enough to justify one being superior to the other.

Trans people also pose a problem when it comes to children and education. Explaining trans people to kids does not need to be heavy or explicit. You can simply say, “Some boys are born as girls, and some girls are born as boys,” and leave it at that until they are older. If the topic goes further, the explanation naturally includes ideas like waiting until a certain age to make important decisions, being sure, and receiving proper support. That alone opens the door to talking about age appropriate boundaries, autonomy, and the fact that children should not be pressured into intimate or life altering decisions, especially by adults.

This is exactly why predators are uncomfortable with the topic. Conversations about trans people make it easier to talk to kids about consent, limits, and the idea that “not yet” is a valid and necessary answer, even if its something you really like or want, like transitioning or wanting to reply that 20s something college student because your friends says it would be cool. It becomes much harder to manipulate or groom a child who understands that some decisions must wait and that adults do not get to override their boundaries.

Predators, and many conservative and religious groups aligned with them, want children to remain as uninformed about sex as possible. No sex education, no discussions, abstinence only narratives, and heavy shame around the topic. Part of this comes from punitive and moralistic views of sex, but another part is that ignorance makes children easier to manipulate. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people already challenged this worldview, and while those groups faced intense backlash, that fight was largely lost. Even so, the “keep it in the bedroom” mentality still allowed them to pretend those identities could be ignored.

Trans people do not fit neatly into that framework. Being trans is not a “bedroom issue.”(Nor is being Gay, Lesbian or Bi, as much as they want, but they can sell that much more easier) While trans people, like everyone else, have private lives, their existence is not limited to sexuality. A gay teacher might never be noticed if the topic never comes up. A trans teacher or a student who is transitioning is visible in a way that cannot be easily erased or ignored. And that visibility forces conversations these groups would rather never happen.",2026-01-15 01:51:54

Greenland and Denmark have firmly rejected any suggestion that the island could be sold or seized, warning that threats of force are reckless and that security concerns should be addressed among allies, not through coercion.

I suspect the next move from Trump is to put pressure on Denmark. Wouldn't surprise me one bit if he starts issuing sanctions against key people tied to Denmark-Greenland relations. 

I've called his bluff when it comes to military action, it is just too stupid and damaging, and he knows it. His style of ""bringing people to the table"" is to bully them and put pressure, but ultimately I think he will TACO on any military invasion. 

What I do expect him to do, is to further bully Denmark. Wouldn't surprise me if he starts threatening with sanctions and trade wars, while his MAGA donors are working in the shadows trying to influence major players in Greenland via investments etc. I think they will try to make some Greenlandic-independence movement grow, backed by MAGA money.

1qd27vl,wiredmagazine,"Since Donald Trump returned to the White House last January, the biggest names in tech have mostly fallen in line with the new regime, [attending dinners](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-ceos-donald-trump-white-house/) with officials, heaping praise upon the administration, presenting the president with [lavish gifts](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNDT6xwCObS/), and pleading for Trump’s permission to sell their [products to China](https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-chips-export-controls-trump-h20-security/). It’s been mostly business as usual for Silicon Valley over the past year, even as the administration ignored a wide range of constitutional norms and attempted to slap arbitrary fees on everything from [chip exports](https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-lisa-su-amd/) to [worker visas](https://www.wired.com/story/dollar3800-flights-and-aborted-takeoffs-how-trumps-h-1b-announcement-panicked-tech-workers/) for high-skilled immigrants employed by tech firms.

But after an [ICE agent](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-jonathan-ross-renee-good-shooting-firearms-trainer-testimony/) shot and killed an unarmed US citizen, Renee Nicole Good, in broad daylight in Minneapolis [last week](https://www.wired.com/story/photo-essay-one-week-since-renee-nicole-good-shooting-in-minnesota/), a number of tech leaders have begun publicly speaking out about the Trump administration’s tactics. This includes prominent researchers at Google and Anthropic, who have denounced the killing as calloused and immoral. The most wealthy and powerful tech CEOs are still staying silent as ICE floods America’s streets, but now some researchers and engineers working for them have chosen to break rank.

More than 150 tech workers have so far signed a petition asking for their company CEOs to call the White House, demand that ICE leave US cities, and speak out publicly against the agency’s recent violence. Anne Diemer, a human resources consultant and former Stripe employee who organized the petition, says that workers at Meta, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, TikTok, Spotify, Salesforce, Linkedin, and Rippling are among those who have signed. The group plans to make the list public once they reach 200 signatories.

“I think so many tech folks have felt like they can’t speak up,” Diemer told WIRED. “I want tech leaders to call the country’s leaders and condemn ICE’s actions, but even if this helps people find their people and take a small part in fighting fascism, then that’s cool, too.”

Yes, the objective reality is that no aspect of gender or sex adheres to a binary. There are more than two ways for chromosomes to be, more than two ways for gonads to develop, more than two configurations of hormones. No aspect of it is a true binary. 

Our gender binary is a linguistic creation that does not have any bearing on reality. The reason this whole thing is so complicated is because the actual answer of ""what is a woman"" is "" a linguistic term used to loosely group the people society places into the feminine side of the imagined binary"".

Gender expression is totally separate.  There is a binary when it comes to who has biology for child bearing and who doesn't .Historically, we've called one a woman and the other a man. If we want new words for them ok great, but you can't just force it on everyone and pretend like the words man and woman haven't had meaning for centuries before today.

1qd1yad,ZuP,"&gt;Reporter Ken Klippenstein’s latest investigation into the inner workings of the Trump regime finds that immigration enforcement agencies ICE and Border Patrol have relaxed recruitment and deployment guidelines in an effort to fill the administration’s sweeping deportation goals.

&gt;“There’s splits within the agency about the shooting [of Renee Good] and the general mission,” says Klippenstein, whose reporting is based on leaked documents and interviews with officials from the Department of Homeland Security.

&gt;Because “they’re worried about sending more experienced agents there who might not agree with the mission,” he explains, DHS is heavily recruiting volunteers with little vetting or training to carry out its deportation mandate. “They have more money than they know what to do with, and they need to fill those roles, and they’re doing everything they can to create them so that the actual personnel head count can match the resources that they now have.”",2026-01-14 22:43:52

1qd1rg9,Quiet-Corner6150,"First the US needs to stop trying to work against the already-existing Civil Rights act and everything it stood for. Being a white man and/or Christian should not be treated like that's ""suffering."" Let's even try to be generally accepting under our original ideas, maybe a ""Renee Good Civil Rights Act"" wouldn't even be necessary if, y'know, we already decided that so-called ""law enforcement"" doesn't get to shoot someone who is essentially fleeing and presenting no danger to *anyone.*",2026-01-14 22:38:59

1qd1rg9,Puzzled-Dress-4904,"The days of civil rights acts are WAY past.  


The article must have been written by a boomer who's nostalgic for the civil Rights and Vietnam War protest days.


Look, I'm in my 70's so I was in a a lot of those civil rights and anti-war demonstrations.   Those kinds of big demonstrations and other things worked better in that media environment which was not nearly as fragmented today. 


The other thing to remember about the civil Rights movement is it wasn't just peaceful protests;  underlying it was a real threat of violence from the Black Panthers and other groups who were fed up with just jawboning. 


I've been to 21 No Kings, Bearing Witness, and other protests since last spring.   They're lots of fun.  But unless there is a threat of real mass organized action - it doesn't necessarily have to be violent, but it has to be disruptive - then protests will accomplish little.  That kind of mass action takes real leadership and right now there are no leaders promoting or organizing it.    ",2026-01-14 22:48:44
1qd1rg9,gingiberiblue,"Yes, is very disheartening the way the civil rights era was couched as non-violent protest.

It was, from a purely historically accurate perspective, a very violent time. Disruptive actions were taken and the undercurrent of those disruptive actions was always, always a very real reminder that the actors were dedicated, organized, and more than willing to rise up if necessary.

Disruptive actions were used as a watching shot across the bow, not as a feel good party on Boston Common.",2026-01-14 23:55:38

Definitely was never about ""protecting the victims"" or ""draining the swamp"" or any of that fluff language.

1qd1061,ChiGuy6124,"""Since returning to the White House a year ago, President Trump has stretched taut the boundaries of executive power in ways both petty and consequential. ""

""These actions have largely gone unchallenged—and at times are even encouraged—by the Republican majority in Congress. That’s partly due to the GOP’s mostly lockstep fealty to Trump. But this is also hardly the first time a president in the modern era has pushed to expand his power, in the process straining constitutional limits and flouting the role of Congress. Indeed, Trump himself did so during his first term, joining his fellow twenty-first-century presidents in straining the bounds of executive action. But he has become bolder in his second term, going much further than his predecessors with his unprecedented and aggressive assertion of executive power. And Congress is allowing it.""

""The relative impotence of the 119th Congress could be seen as the continuation of a decades-long trend, one defined by the strengthening of the modern presidency and heightened partisanship. These dynamics have enabled a weak legislature—one that may struggle to re assert its constitutional mandate as a coequal branch of the government. Generally, when Congress cedes ground to the executive branch, it rarely gains it back.""

“It’s not just a weak Congress. We’ve had lots of weak Congresses,” said Joanne Freeman, a history professor at Yale University. “It’s a stagnant Congress. It’s a Congress that has willingly given up its power to an executive that wants to get as much power as it could get.”

""Trump’s defiance of congressional oversight extends to actions that might otherwise be bipartisan. During the 43-day government shutdown last fall, he authorized the continuation of military salaries, using money that had been appropriated for other purposes. Although a measure authorizing military pay likely would have received bipartisan support, Trump took unilateral action. (House Speaker Mike Johnson had sent members home during the shutdown, an action that Democrats argued was an effort to delay a vote on the Epstein files.)""

""The modern military offers an example of how the executive has gained more power since the twentieth century. Since World War II, Congress has continued to appropriate military funding at high levels, most recently approving a nearly $901 billion National Defense Authorization Act late last year. The passage of open-ended Authorizations for the Use of Military Force, with limited interest in repealing them even decades later, has also permitted presidents to involve the country in foreign conflicts without congressional oversight.""

“Every year they specifically decide to build a trillion-dollar army for another year,” Glassman said of Congress. “What’s the natural consequence of building a trillion-dollar army? Because the world’s really dangerous, and wars happen really fast now, the side effect is, unfortunately, that the president now has all these toys to go on little tiny wars.”

""The judiciary has also played a significant role in weakening the power of Congress. Congress used to have a power known as the legislative veto: It would grant an authority to the president but reserved the right to overturn it with a simple majority vote that did not require a presidential signature. In 1983, the Supreme Court deemed that procedure unconstitutional.""

""Today’s conservative-majority Supreme Court has continued to bolster Trump’s authorities, even as it has occasionally undermined the actions of previous presidents who attempted to circumvent congressional authority.

Hell, Trump already categorically refused to take in refugees from Iran.

The supreme leader of Iran has referred to protestors as agent provocateurs, working for his enemies.

Does this sound familiar to you?

That's because Donald Trump has used the same rhetoric towards protestors here in the United States. A pretty striking parallel.

And are we forgetting that Trump has been escalating tensions and provocations between the US and Iran for years?

Starting with how in 2018, Trump issued devastating sanctions against Iranian oil and its international banking system. This has had a measurable impact on Iran's economic problems, and problems that are at the center of some of these protests.

Congress perceived Trump as such a dangerous interventionist, that they had to pass not one—but two historic war powers resolutions to curb his appetite for conflict during his first term. There was even talk of voting on a third resolution in response to Trump's recent actions in the middle east.

One of the resolutions was passed to prevent a war with Iran after Trump authorized the strike that killed an Iranian general

Iran responded to Soleimani's assassination by attacking US military bases in Iraq. Dozens of military personnel suffered from traumatic brain injuries, but Trump dismissed these injuries as mere ""headaches."" So much for his ""love of the troops.""

The assassination of Soleimani, coupled with Trump's decision to abandon the JCPOA out of sheer spite for Obama, together with his failed attempts at ""negotiating"" a new nuclear deal with Iran, AND alongside his reckless foreign policy decisions—all of these things played a role in triggering a regional war between Israel and Iran and precipitating America's involvement.

And even though Trump decided to get the US military involved, a U.S. intelligence assessment recently found that only one out of three targeted nuclear sites suffered significant damage.

Additionally, it's been reported that Iran managed to move its enriched uranium and centrifuges before the strikes.

But Trump has proudly claimed to have ""destroyed"" all of Iran's nuclear sites and capabilities, while also insisting that he ""stopped the war;"" adding this to his ""wars that I ended"" list.

Talks immediately broke off between Iran and the US and experts say Iran/Tehran could eventually resume its nuclear and uranium enrichment program. 

It should also go without saying that the larger conflict has not been resolved and that tensions between the US and Iran have not deescalated either. No semblance of a present, nor lasting peace exists in the region.

Claims from Trump and his administration that liken him to some kind of benevolent, master negotiator and peace bringer are just another series of lies and false narratives concocted by a government utterly lacking in transparency and integrity.

Iran has not forgotten about Trump's provocations either, which is part of the reason why nuclear talks failed, why further talks between the US, Iran and Israel came to an abrupt halt, leading to regional war, and why Iran still vows retaliation to this day.

In response to Trump's interventions in the middle east, Iran has also escalated their cyber attacks against the US while reports indicate that Iran has targeted Trump and his allies for assassination.

Tensions in the Persian gulf have only heightened due to Trump's foreign policy over the years; which has helped lay the groundwork for more hostilities.",2026-01-14 23:14:40

Trump has bashed Rubio’s wife, insulted Graham and threatened to have primaries for anyone who opposed him. There were resignations, and others opted to term out instead of playing such a game.

Sen. Lindsey Graham criticized Donald Trump for refusing to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to secret grand jury testimony.

Along with Graham, prominent Republicans also denied Trump’s plans, including Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.

1qd035z,Choice-of-SteinsGate,"The GOP has seized on this post Jan 6th environment to sow distrust in our elections. They have piggybacked off Trump's lies of election fraud; tapping into a stockpile of conspiracy theories, falsehoods, and misinformation to dissuade and deceive the public, and to carry out a nationwide campaign of disenfranchisement and voter suppression.

Republicans continue to exploit the misinformed. They've taken advantage of the ignorance, the partisanship and the mindless distrust of voters; capitalizing off of this moment to empower themselves with more legal authority to challenge election results while granting their party more power, control and supervision over our election system.

They can now deny, subvert, challenge and potentially overturn future elections with near impunity.

Republicans are consolidating power at an alarming rate; abusing their trifecta and their control over state legislatures to give themselves the ultimate say on how maps are drawn; unilaterally deciding who their voters are and not the other way around.

This brazen mid-census redistricting effort would also not be possible without Trump giving himself and his party a license to say f-ck all to democratic norms for the sake of maintaining their grip on power. It's shamelessly unAmerican.

To make matters worse, Trump has been federalizing the military and local law enforcement in order to centralize authoritarian control over US cities and urban areas; a military presence he will undoubtedly utilize to suppress the vote in upcoming elections.

On top of all of this, Republicans are currently scheming their way through the courts in an attempt to dilute the minority vote by challenging section 2 of the voting Rights Act. A historically significant provision meant to protect voters from being unfairly sequestered and disenfranchised.

Republicans have the gall to say they're ""protecting the integrity of elections,"" while making every effort to subvert the vote, crudely redraw maps, limit voter participation, alter the census in their favor, reshape districts along racial lines, and influence election outcomes.",2026-01-14 23:17:03

1qczvzl,Hrmbee,"A number of concerning issues from the article:

&gt;An epidemic of a deadly lung disease among hundreds of workers who cut kitchen and bathroom countertops has regulators on opposite sides of the country considering two drastically different responses this week.
&gt;
&gt;In a California hearing on Thursday, workplace safety regulators will be discussing a proposed ban on cutting so-called quartz or engineered stone, a popular choice for countertops. That's because this material creates an unusual amount of lung-damaging silica dust when it gets cut or polished, far more than natural granite or marble.
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile in Washington, Republicans on a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee convened a hearing to discuss a bill that would instead ban workers' ability to bring lawsuits against the companies that manufacture and sell the raw slabs of this engineered material.
&gt;
&gt;""They've got it backwards. It's not the lawsuits that should be banned, it's the stone slabs that should be banned, because they are deadly and they cannot be fabricated safely,"" says Raphael Metzger, an attorney in California who represents numerous countertop workers and says hundreds of lawsuits are ongoing.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;""In my years in occupational health, I have never seen an industry say, 'We sell a dangerous product but we have no responsibility for it once it leaves our factory, and rather than protect workers downstream, we are the ones who need protection from lawsuits,' "" says David Michaels, an epidemiologist with George Washington University and a former director of OSHA, the federal workplace safety agency.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;The steady rise in serious cases of lung disease has prompted the Western Occupational &amp; Environmental Medical Association (WOEMA), a group of workplace health experts in 7 Western states, to petition California's Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board to simply ban the cutting of engineered stone with high amounts of silica.
&gt;
&gt;""The material itself is even more dangerous than we thought,"" says Robert Blink, a doctor in California who specializes in work-related medical problems and who is a former WOEMA president. He says the number of new serious illnesses and deaths is ""impossible to tolerate.""
&gt;
&gt;Even in shops that have put dust controls in place, he says, researchers have measured unsafe levels of silica.
&gt;
&gt;He says there's an estimated 4,000 countertop workers in California, which means so far, about 12% have developed serious illnesses. ""As time goes on, and these cases continue to be identified, the number is approaching the Australia numbers,"" he says, noting that after a similar crisis began in Australian countertop workers, that country banned engineered stone completely.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;During Wednesday's congressional hearing, Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., questioned why Congress would effectively grant a kind of legal immunity to the makers and suppliers of a fashionable countertop material.
&gt;
&gt;He noted that the CEO of Cambria, Marty Davis, is a Republican donor, and said the apparent goal of the proposed legislation ""was to give a handout to a millionaire friend of none other than Donald Trump"" while countertop workers ""struggle to make ends meet, struggle to stay alive, actually.""
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Michaels, the former OSHA director, says there simply aren't enough workplace inspectors to go to thousands of countertop fabrication shops and make sure that they are following the rules, and OSHA is facing funding cuts.
&gt;
&gt;He hopes this proposed legislation to ban the workers' lawsuits never comes to a vote in Congress.
&gt;
&gt;""This legislation is a death sentence for workers in this industry,"" says Michaels. ""If there is no obligation of these manufacturers and distributors to ensure that the downstream users of their products are safe, we will continue to see more and more cases of silicosis, more and more lung transplant cases, more and more deaths.""

There are precedents here for the banning of useful materials that pose hazards to workers and end-users. Two prominent ones that we're still dealing with decades later are lead and asbestos. If these high-silica countertop materials are posing such a danger to workers and others who deal with them, then it would be useful for the industry to innovate, and re-engineer these materials to decrease the hazards inherent in these materials. Looking for legislative relief because they want to continue to do what they do without modification is frankly unconscionable. And, the cutting of OSHA budgets (along with most other public service positions dealing with public health and safety) by this current administration is certainly not helping matters in the slightest.",2026-01-14 21:34:31

Trump is doing exactly what Alexander Dugin laid out in The Foundation of Geopolitics. 

Extremism is the norm in the United States now. We’re about to crash out over Greenland. We’re reinstating the Monroe Doctrine, and giving up influence in Africa(USAID), India, and the Middle East while we’re at it. 

I won’t say Trump is doing this on purpose, but someone is directing him to do this through some lever, on purpose. 

We don’t need to leave NATO, we just need to destroy it. Then Putin will have won, and suddenly the US won’t be needed by anyone at that point. 

An attack on Greenland would force the NATO states to either attack the US, or concede the island and vote to disband and rebuild a new alliance without their largest source of military equipment and troops. 

Markets will crash, trade will be strangled, and isolationists will thrive by controlling their internal economies.

&gt;**Three months later**, Trump paid $90k for a full-page ad in the New York Times where he criticized the United States' support for NATO. He discusses it with Larry King on that same day in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8wJc7vHcTs).

&gt;We don’t know, but Eastern Bloc security service records suggest this may have been as early as 1977. That was the year when Trump married Ivana Zelnickova, a twenty-eight-year-old model from Czechoslovakia.

Small skirmishes around Greenland will fit the Europeans just fine. On that scale it only matters who has more modern equipment, better intel and the better strategy. On all fronts Europe is better than any other adversary the USA has faces since WO2. Actual size of forces will not be a factor. It is not that Europe will not be capable.

We’re still in NATO, but if things were *that* far gone, what are we realistically doing over here besides being collateral damage? Not to mention the U.S. would probably start a civil war with itself first. So now we’ve got defectors crossing into Canada and suddenly we’re dragged into your internal collapse on top of everything else.

I also can’t imagine Europeans actually unifying for a war over Greenland or Canada either, no hate to my European friends. But Turkish interests are not Danish interests just as an example. European countries can barely agree on economic policy, you think they’re going to tank their own economies to tank the U.S.? 

It’s all so incoherent that the only explanation is the obvious one and that is that Trump is fucking insane. “WW3” wouldn’t be some grand alliance-based conflict with a noble cause, it would be scattered chaos, Trump declaring ownership of whatever country, and threatening to drop first nuke. and having Trump at the helm in that scenario is genuinely terrifying. He’s been openly excited about using nukes since his first term, like a petulant child mad he can’t play with the toys. No has never meant no to him, it's either a forced yes or a “maybe not right now, but soon (2 weeks)”

If Trump actually has imperial ambitions for North America, Canada, Greenland, Mexico, Cuba, etc. would all just be fucked, which gives credence to the fact Americans might not have real voting rights again, because a lot of countries would do nothing thinking this will change soon. Republicans are spineless, but I don't understand how they don't understand that this is just someone actively looking for a justification. And the most insane part is that if there were a genuinely defensible war to support, it would obviously be Ukraine.

I would like to ask anyone who voted for Trump or didn’t vote at all; 

Did you really not care who you entrusted the power to end the world to, or was that thought 5th or 6th down your list of priorities. Did you think about it at all at the ballot box, or while doing something you found more important than voting? 

If so, you haven’t been paying attention to the world outside your own superficial interests. 

But I cannot blame you. 

Conservatives and corporate interests have made us what we are. Distracted, self-interested, fearful, angry, and suspicious of those not like “us”. A perfect environment from which to cultivate an authoritarian dictator.

The constitution very specifically has a mode for being shredded: a constitutional convention. Which would be the smart way for them to do an authoritarian takeover, as opposed to what they’re currently doing. 

Their only pathway for the road they are on is to basically deny seating the next congress and then refuse to certify new presidential elections. Which does not shred the constitution but nonetheless gives them full control of the federal government. And they know that when they do this they will face challenges from the states, which is why they’re preparing for war.

&gt;Lugert-Thom said that the officers who’d knocked on her door were not displaying their badges clearly, and did not identify themselves before they began questioning her about a picture of someone they were searching for.

&gt;“They said, ‘This is for your safety. We need to find this person,’” Lugert-Thom recalled to the *Tribune* in a story published Monday.
