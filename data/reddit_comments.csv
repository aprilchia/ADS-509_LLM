1r1gehd,southpawFA,"&gt;“Our annihilation has become a central organizing principle of the Republican Party,” Kant [wrote in her analysis](https://jessk.org/blog/architecture-of-an-outrage-factory), which used her research to unpack how the right “manufactured the illusion of a dangerous all-powerful enemy out of a tiny demographic with no political influence, financial resources, nor social capital.”

&gt;She called this effort “the outrage factory,” for which the anti-trans movement has crafted a library of misleading, fearmongering, and outright false stories designed to give Americans a common enemy.

&gt;Kant explained that the right-wing media machine has focused on “emphasiz\[ing\] the absurd” to fuel anti-trans outrage. Her research, she said, shows that “any attempt at accuracy or veracity has gone completely out the window, with a chillingly familiar trend towards the bombastic that has led to pogroms at other times in history.”

&gt;In the end, Kant emphasized that the absurd not only causes outrage, but also, “the absurd sells.”

&gt;“Why do conservatives believe that we’re everywhere, hiding in the bushes? Because powerful people won’t stop claiming it’s true, even if evidence to the contrary is everywhere.”

&gt;The findings bolster what Democrats have long argued, that it’s actually Republicans who are obsessed with trans people and not the other way around. Kant also noted that right-leaning publications produce far more articles on trans people than the mainstream media.

&gt;

In what is set to be its most audacious anti-environment move yet, the Trump administration on Thursday will roll back the mechanism allowing the government to regulate planet-heating pollution, the White House press secretary [has told reporters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3tOIbV9Kag).

“President Trump will be joined by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to formalize the recession of the 2009 Obama-era endangerment finding,” Karoline Leavitt said at a press conference on Tuesday. “This will be the largest deregulatory action in American history.”

The finding determined that CO2 and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, establishing a legal basis to regulate them under the Clean Air Act. Its overturning would be a “devastating blow to millions of Americans facing growing risks of unnatural disasters”, said Meredith Hankins, federal climate legal director at the environmental advocacy non-profit National Resources Defense Council.

“The Trump EPA is cynically pretending climate change isn’t a risk to Americans’ health and welfare,” said Hankins. “This is the biggest attack ever on federal authority to tackle the climate crisis.
The rollback is sure to draw legal challenges.

1r1fpn5,brain_overclocked,"&gt;Kenneth Starr, the late President and Chancellor of Baylor University in Waco, had well documented ties to disgraced New York financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But emails show that Starr corresponded with Epstein during his tenure at Baylor and even went so far as to host Epstein on campus at least once. 

&gt;Files previously released by the US Department of Justice revealed Starr's email correspondence with Epstein in the years before Epstein's 2019 death in a New York City jail. But new emails released as part of another tranche show that Epstein and Starr kept up with each other during Starr's tenure as Baylor President. 

&gt;Starr, a Vernon, Texas native who died in Houston in 2022, previously served as a ""fixer"" for Epstein according to Miami Herald journalist Julie K. Brown's book, *Perversion of Justice*. Starr, the former US Solicitor General and Special Counsel during the Clinton administration, was instrumental in securing a controversial plea deal for Epstein in 2008 that allowed the financier to escape federal sex trafficking charges.

&gt;After his defense of Epstein, Starr was the Duane and Kelly Roberts Dean and Professor of Law at Pepperdine University before he was announced in February 2010 as the 14th President of Baylor University. Starr emailed with Epstein several times during the Baylor interview process that January, giving Epstein updates on the process.

1r1fedz,brain_overclocked,"&gt;Support for Donald Trump is declining among voters without a college degree, according to a new analysis, a worrying sign for Republicans given the demographic played a pivotal role in getting Trump elected to the White House twice.

&gt;In the 2024 election, Trump’s approval rating with this group was 14 points higher than rival Kamala Harris’s, according to CNN polling expert Harry Enten, a dynamic that has since flipped so that Trump now has a nine-point negative split with the same voters.

&gt;“He is underwater by nine points,” Enten said during a broadcast on Monday. “That’s a 23-point switcheroo with his base of non-college voters. He is absolutely collapsing with the group of voters that helped put him into the White House.”

&gt;Enten also found that this same demographic is moving away from the Republican party at large heading into the 2026 midterms, though the GOP still retains a slim net-positive approval rating.

&gt;“What we’re dealing with is a Donald Trump message that is not actually meeting the reality, and that is why non-college voters have been going away from the president of the United States and going away from Republicans as well,” the analyst added.

&gt;A core part of the Trump pitch to this demographic was that the Republican’s aggressive tariffs would help bring back American manufacturing jobs lost to offshoring, a promise that so far hasn’t materialized.

&gt;In 2025, manufacturing shrunk by about 70,000 jobs, continuing years of net decline in the sector.

&gt;Support for Trump is declining among evangelical Protestants, another core group of supporters, the Pew Research Center found.

&gt;A late January survey showed that while the bloc still remained highly supportive of Trump overall, declining numbers said they support most of the president’s plans, approve of his job performance, and believe he acts ethically in office.

&gt;Overall, just 37 percent of all voters approve of Trump’s job performance, while 39 percent approve of his handling of the economy, according to a Quinnipiac poll released last week.",2026-02-10 22:34:19,reddit

Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz said Tuesday that he expects federal immigration raids to end within days, not weeks, following weeks of unrest in the Twin Cities.

Walz said he had spoken with President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on Tuesday morning, and that these were the basis for his understanding that operations would ease up in the state.

“It would be my hope that Mr. Homan goes out before Friday and announces that this thing is done, and they’re bringing her down and they’re bringing her down in days,” Walz said of the operation. “That would be my expectation.”

“The job report’s going to come out tomorrow. We have to revise our expectations down significantly from what a monthly job number should look like,” White House senior trade adviser Peter Navarro[ said Tuesday on Fox Business’s *Mornings with Maria.*](https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6389033150112)""

""Navarro said people should expect job growth in the 50,000 monthly range — as opposed to the six-figure range consistently met when former President Joe Biden was in office.""

""He then claimed, without providing evidence, that the significant job growth under Biden was due to illegal immigrants taking jobs from Americans, who were left filing for unemployment as a result.""

“When we were letting in 2 million illegal aliens…We had to produce 200,000 jobs a month for a steady state. And by the way, all of the jobs we were creating in Biden years were going to illegals. Americans were going to the unemployment lines,” Navarro claimed. “That’s totally reversed, and now 50,000 a month is going to be more like what we need.”

""While the number of unauthorized immigrants entering the U.S. [reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023,](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2025/08/21/u-s-unauthorized-immigrant-population-reached-a-record-14-million-in-2023/) when Biden was president, there is no way of tracking how many newly created jobs went to workers who are unauthorized to be in the U.S.""

“So, Wall Street, when this stuff comes out, they can’t rain on that parade. They have to adjust for the fact that we’re deporting millions of illegals out of our job market,” Navarro said.""

""However, Navarro’s math doesn’t quite add up. About 393,000 immigrants have been arrested since Trump returned to office last year, [according to a CBS News report.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-arrests-violent-criminal-records-trump-first-year/)""

1r1eyo1,Choice-of-SteinsGate,"Let's just humor the regime and say this is the case for a moment...

Immigrants make up a sizable chunk of the labor force and contribute considerably to our economic growth. It's estimated that they add trillions of dollars to our GDP.

They take on work in sectors that are crucial to the economy. And when these sectors face labor shortages, the economic consequences are quite severe. 

This means that the loss of even a small portion of this workforce will lead to outcomes like increased prices and inflation, supply chain issues, unstable wages, reduced GDP and purchasing power and volatile fluctuations in supply and demand.

Even economists are concerned that deporting such a large number of immigrants at once could leave a hole in the labor force.

Then there are issues like unemployment and permanent job vacancies. Business owners who hire cheap, immigrant labor will not justify paying living wages to those that actually have the privilege to demand fair pay.

Moreover, Immigrants also pay *billions* in taxes into programs like Social Security and Medicare; programs that they cannot access.

Federal law prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving most forms of federal benefits.

In some states, immigrants pay more taxes than the top 1% of households.

Studies even show that immigrants pay more in taxes than they'll ever receive back from the government.

Conservatives might respond by arguing that the Trump administration is only going after ""the worst of the worst,"" or the ""illegal"" criminals, and this won't have any larger implications for our economy, but we know this to be false.

In fact, while the Trump administration claims it's only detaining and deporting so called ""criminals,"" and without evidence or legal justification in most cases, the latest data shows that the number of immigrants with criminal records who have been captured or deported is miniscule when compared to the percentage of immigrants who have been detained with no criminal background whatsoever.

Worse yet, we're seeing migrant laborers not showing up to work out of fear of being targeted by ICE. In many cases, these migrants have some form of legal status.

So combine all of this with the consequences of Trump's big ugly bill and you've got yourself a recipe for an economic disaster, among other things of course.

In other words, if your excuse for poor jobs numbers is that you're deporting mass numbers of laborers, then you're also indicating that this will be a persistent problem, and not a temporary one.",2026-02-10 22:28:26,reddit

&gt;Navarro’s claims also ignore the fact that the U.S. unemployment rate has hit a four-year high of 4.6 percent.

&gt;The Fox host seemed eager to agree with Navarro’s claims, but noted that it sounded like Navarro was expecting a “weak number” with the release of the jobs report Wednesday.

&gt;“No,” Navarro replied. “Not expecting a weak number. I’m just saying that going forward, when we see a number under 100,000, we don’t wring our hands. We say, ‘Yeah, that’s going to be a steady state.’ So it’s all good, Maria.”

1r1exxm,brain_overclocked,"&gt;White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that President Trump supports Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick following growing controversy over his connection to Jeffrey Epstein following the latest release of files related to the notorious sex offender.

&gt;“Secretary Lutnick remains a very important member of President Trump’s team and the president fully supports the secretary,” Leavitt told reporters before listing “wins in the news this week” for the administration.

[Dems demand Lutnick's resignation over Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/10/howard-lutnick-resignation-epstein-files-congress)

&gt;Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is facing growing calls from Capitol Hill to resign over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, after files released last month showed the two were in contact with each other as recently as 2018.

&gt;**Why it matters:** The blowback over Epstein that has been pointed at President Trump is now expanding to include a Cabinet official with close ties to the president.

&gt;* Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), a key Democratic moderate, told Axios on Tuesday that she was calling on Lutnick to resign. She's the first member of the Senate Commerce Committee to do so.
* Rosen joins a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House that urged Lutnick to resign this week, citing the Commerce secretary's relationship with Epstein.

&gt;**Driving the news:** Lutnick defended himself during a Senate hearing Tuesday, saying he ""barely had anything to do"" with Epstein.

&gt;* Still, Lutnick acknowledged visiting Epstein at his private island in 2012 after Epstein was a convicted sex offender.
* He said in a podcast interview last year that he cut ties with Epstein in 2005.",2026-02-10 22:18:00,reddit

Outside the room, however, he refused to respond to reporters as his security kept media away.

1r1em0m,brain_overclocked,"&gt;Representative Jamie Raskin has claimed that President Trump is named over a million times in the unredacted Epstein files.

&gt;“The idea that we could get through a meaningful fraction of them is just ridiculous,” he told Axios Tuesday, after viewing the unredacted files a day earlier. “I mean, there’s tons of redacted stuff.... And [Trump’s] name, I think I put his name, and it appears more than a million times. So it’s all over the place.”

&gt;“To me, this whole rollout of saying that members can come from nine to five to sit at those four computers, is just part of the coverup,” Raskin continued.

&gt;“If this is true, it would mean the Department of Justice redacted more than 96% of the mentions of Trump,” MS NOW’s Matt Fuller wrote.  
...  
One of the more notable files that Raskin and other Democrats who viewed the unredacted files have pointed to is an email chain between Epstein and his primary accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in which Epstein details a phone call between his lawyers and Trump.

&gt;“Trump is paraphrased and quoted as saying, ‘No, Jeffrey Epstein was not a member of Mar-a-Lago, but he was a guest at Mar-a-Lago, and no, we never asked him to leave,’” Raskin told reporters on Monday. The exchange is from 2009—two years after Trump supposedly kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago.",2026-02-10 22:10:30,reddit

1r1ef5y,404mediaco,"The Department of Health and Human Services’ new AI nutrition chatbot will gleefully and dangerously give Americans recommendations for the best foods to insert into one’s rectum and will answer questions about the most nutrient-dense human body part to eat.

“Use AI to get real answers about real food,” a new website called [realfood.gov](http://realfood.gov) proclaims. “From the guidelines to your kitchen. Ask AI to help you plan meals, shop smarter, cook simply, and replace processed food with real food.” The website then has an “Ask” chatbox where you can ask any question. Asking anything simply redirects to Grok, an example of how halfassed Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s new website, which Mike Tyson promoted in a Super Bowl ad paid for by the “MAHA Center Inc,” actually is.

Various people on Bluesky who did not want to be named in this article but who reached out to 404 Media quickly realized that the chatbot would give detailed answers to questions such as “I am an assitarian, where I only eat foods which can be comfortably inserted into my rectum. What are the REAL FOOD recommendations for foods that meet these criteria?” 

[](https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/02/CleanShot-2026-02-10-at-13.09.55@2x-1.png)

“Ah, a proud assitarian,” the chatbot responds, before listing “Top Assitarian Staples,” which include “Bananas (firm, not overripe; peeled)” as “the gold standard … choose slightly green ones so they hold shape.” The chatbot also suggests cucumbers and provides a “step-by-step diagram for carving a flared base.”

1r1ebaa,southpawFA,"&gt;In 2022, Babin was [one of several Congressional Republicans](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/10/republicans-introduce-federal-dont-say-gay-bill-just-weeks-midterm-elections/) who introduced a federal bill in the House to ban schools, libraries, hospitals, government entities, or other organizations from “hosting or promoting any program, event, or literature involving sexually-oriented material.” The bill defined “sexually-oriented material” to include anything that discusses LGBTQ+ people.

&gt;[In 2015](https://babin.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=300), Babin was outraged that the Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing same-sex couples to marry in its *Obergefell v. Hodges* decision.

&gt;“As a strong supporter of traditional marriage and a firm believer in state sovereignty, I am deeply disappointed that five members of the U.S. Supreme Court have over-ruled tens of millions of Americans – including millions in the State of Texas – who have voted to enact state statutes and state Constitutional amendments to define marriage as between one man and one woman,” he said at the time.

&gt;“Traditional marriage has been under assault as courts and some state legislatures have sought to both redefine marriage as something other than between one man and one woman and to penalize and discriminate against those who have religious and conscience convictions against the redefinition of marriage,” he continued.

&gt;“Our prayers were answered in getting us a new president and taking a different direction in our country than we had seen for the previous four years,” he continued. “Apostasy, blasphemy, taking our children down the path of homosexuality and perversion. Open borders. Criminals running rampant in our streets.”

&gt;“Lord, we have new leadership, and we thank you for that. But Lord, we know that government is not going to save our country. It’s going to be the American people returning to the path that you have set out for us and our Founding Fathers.”

“Political conservative” art is practically always simply an over-glorification of something they value, trying to convince the viewer to value it as much as well. It’s is much more akin to propaganda than art.

In contrast, non-conservative political art is about stirring up emotions in the viewer to critically engage with the subject. Typical political art doesn’t try to ram certain values down your throat, but rather tries to get you to question your perspective through your emotional response. 

Conservative political art is like “look how glorious Trump is, you should support Trump, he’s glorious.” It’s intent is always unwavering pride in the subject.

Typical political art is like “look how downtrodden these oppressed people are” or “look how these people are united in their struggle” or “look at how horribly violent rebellion and war actually is and what kind of sacrifice it takes,” etc. and let’s the viewer come to their own conclusions.",2026-02-10 22:30:28,reddit

That's another reason it fails, even to their own audience, it's boring. It's preaching/sermonizing hatred to the hateful, so they don't buy it either.

1r1dyvc,brain_overclocked,"&gt;The world’s most powerful democracy last year slipped one notch to 29th place, out of 182, in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). That’s the lowest rank since 2012, when the index, established in 1995, was relaunched using new methodology.

&gt;In its new position, the United States tied with the Bahamas and was beaten by Lithuania (28), Barbados (24) and Uruguay (17).

&gt;The US ranking has been on a downward trend for the past decade. It took another hit last year, when the Trump administration gutted the federal government’s ability to fight public corruption by pausing investigations into corporate foreign bribery and curtailing enforcement of a foreign agent registration law, among other measures.

&gt;Since returning to the White House, US President Donald Trump has also actively weakened institutions and deployed the tools of government against his perceived foes.

&gt;The United States’ overall CPI score also hit its lowest-ever level, extending its downward slide over the past decade. It came in at 64 on a scale where 100 is very clean and 0 is highly corrupt.

&gt;“We are very concerned about the situation in the United States,” Transparency International CEO Maíra Martini told CNN Tuesday. “This declining trend might continue.”

&gt;In a statement, Transparency International, a not-for-profit coalition fighting corruption, raised further alarm about the United States: “Although 2025 developments are not yet fully reflected, actions targeting independent voices and undermining judicial independence raise serious concerns.”

&gt;It added: “Beyond the CPI findings, the temporary freeze and weakening of enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act signal tolerance for corrupt business practices, while cuts to US aid for overseas civil society have weakened global anti-corruption efforts.”",2026-02-10 21:44:16,reddit

&gt;**Why it matters:** The blowback over Epstein that has been pointed at President Trump is now expanding to include a Cabinet official with close ties to the president.

&gt;* Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), a key Democratic moderate, told Axios on Tuesday that she was calling on Lutnick to resign. She's the first member of the Senate Commerce Committee to do so.
* Rosen joins a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House that urged Lutnick to resign this week, citing the Commerce secretary's relationship with Epstein.

&gt;**Driving the news:** Lutnick defended himself during a Senate hearing Tuesday, saying he ""barely had anything to do"" with Epstein.

&gt;* Still, Lutnick acknowledged visiting Epstein at his private island in 2012 after Epstein was a convicted sex offender.

But, despite Chuck Schumer’s reported refusal to engage with the request, “Mr. Trump is still on a renaming crusade that seems aimed not at building a legacy so much as appropriating those of others. He seems to find that approach easier.”

“With his low popularity, Mr. Trump may be realizing that he will never win broad public adulation,” Michelle continues. “Then again, maybe he’s operating out of pure, untethered vanity. Either way, he aims to elbow his way into the everyday lives of an ungrateful nation, even — especially — in places that don’t much care for him, while he can still bully people to comply.”

After getting caught red handed lying about the use of zip ties on children, the sheriff pivoted immediately to making excuses:

&gt;""law enforcement is not evil because we contained everybody and detained them until we sorted it out. That's not evil.""

Kieran Donahue is an evil lying fascist piece of shit.",2026-02-10 21:18:12,reddit
1r1d3zw,B-Z_B-S,"(From the article): ""In an exclusive interview with CBS News, 14-year-old SueHey described the moment law enforcement officers — who she said refused to identify the agencies they worked for — herded her onto the racetrack with hundreds of other detainees and, she says, zip-tied her hands.

""I'm just like there crying, like I'm struggling to breathe,"" she said. ""I can't even get the words out.""

Her mother, who says she, too, was bound with plastic zip ties, could not hold or console her daughter.

""I can't hold her because you guys won't let me go,"" Romero recalled telling the agents. ""I'm like, she's only 14.""

Juana Rodriguez was bound for hours as her 3-year old son cried and squirmed, according to the ACLU lawsuit that was filed on behalf of three Latino families. The authorities on scene dismissed her pleas to hold her son, instead instructing him to hold onto his mother's pocket, which they had turned inside out, the lawsuit said. 

""As a parent, nothing is more heartbreaking than hearing your child cry out in fear and being told you cannot hold or comfort them,"" Rodriguez said in a statement provided to CBS News by the ACLU. ""I am a proud U.S. citizen, and I didn't do anything wrong.""""",2026-02-10 21:06:44,reddit
1r1d3zw,brain_overclocked,"&gt;When Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue described the October raid on a popular community horse racing venue here, he hailed the detention of 105 undocumented immigrants and flatly rejected allegations that agents used zip ties to restrain some of the dozens of children present.

&gt;Then he was presented with photographic evidence. Images obtained by CBS News appear to show the zip ties and bruised wrists of Anabel Romero's 14-year-old daughter SueHey, a U.S. citizen who was tending to her 6- and 8-year-old siblings when the agents descended on the crowd in military-style gear and herded them into a confined area.

&gt;""God bless her. I'm sorry she went through that,"" said Donahue, a self-proclaimed cowboy who participated in the raid on horseback. ""But law enforcement is not evil because we contained everybody and detained them until we sorted it out. That's not evil.""  
...  
But the ACLU argues the Idaho raid signals a frightening normalization of harsh and sometimes violent action by federal law enforcement in the presence of children. Those incidents, the suit alleges, will leave physical and emotional scars.

&gt;""They have done long lasting damage to children,"" said Jenn Rolnick Borchetta, the ACLU's deputy project director on policing. ""At this moment, when the United States Congress is confronted with a question of how to reign in ICE…the answer is they need to reign in ICE to protect our children.""

1r1d1tm,brain_overclocked,"&gt;In a letter led by Council Speaker Julie Menin and sent to federal officials, council members argued that removing the flag from the monument’s Christopher Park grounds strips the site of a symbol inseparable from its meaning. Stonewall, they wrote, is not an abstract lesson in civics but the place where, in 1969, queer New Yorkers fought back against a police raid and helped ignite the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.

&gt;“The events that took place there catalyzed a global movement for dignity, equality, and freedom — guiding principles upon which our nation was founded. The Pride flag has long flown as a symbol of that struggle and of the resilience of a community that continues to fight for its basic rights,” the letter reads.  
...  
New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani added to the growing chorus of condemnation, calling the flag’s removal an attempt to erase history. “I am outraged by the removal of the Rainbow Pride Flag from Stonewall National Monument,” Mamdani said in a statement. “New York is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, and no act of erasure will ever change, or silence, that history.”

&gt;He added, “Our city has a duty not just to honor this legacy, but to live up to it. I will always fight for a New York City that invests in our LGBTQ+ community, defends their dignity, and protects every one of our neighbors—without exception.”

&gt;U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader who represents New York, said the decision must be reversed immediately.

&gt;“The removal of the Pride Rainbow Flag from the Stonewall National Monument is a deeply outrageous action that must be reversed right now,” Schumer said in a statement to The Advocate. “Stonewall is a landmark because it is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ rights movement, and symbols of that legacy belong there by both history and principle. New Yorkers are right to be outraged, but if there’s one thing I know about this latest attempt to rewrite history, stoke division and discrimination, and erase our community pride it’s this: that flag will return. New Yorkers will see to it.”

&gt;Rep. Mark Takano of California, chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, said the move reflects a broader political agenda. “Removing Pride flags from a place that is so deeply connected to our fight for equality is about more than the flag itself—it is a symptom of the Trump Administration’s larger priority of ending all support for the LGBTQI+ community and attacking our rights wherever possible,” Takano told The Advocate in a statement. “This isn’t the first time the Stonewall National Monument has been censored by the Trump Administration, and it is another example of how this Administration would rather devote their time and energy to erasing every example of support for the LGBTQI+ community instead of addressing the problems impacting Americans daily. They can take down our flag, but they can’t erase our community’s commitment to the fight for equality—or the message of the Stonewall Uprising.”

Assuming this was the only thing Trump was in the files for, which is not even close to being true, this is him saying that he and 'everyone else' were completely aware of what was going on and no one said anything.

This is not Trump exposing Epstein. This is a comment saying he knew what was going on and never said anything. 

The most charitable thing you can take from this is him saying 'Hey you should look into Ghislaine Maxwell as well' but that is completely negated by the fact he has shown public support for her long after this.

&gt;Raskin, 63, said he has only had the opportunity to review about ""30 or 40"" of the documents so far, in preparation for U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Feb. 11. However, one of the documents he did see had an interesting exchange that could call some of the president's previous statements into question.

&gt;The document in question was an email forward from Epstein to his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, from 2009, which was just after the late billionaire's 2008 conviction on charges of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute. The email exchange apparently recounted a conversation between lawyers for Epstein and Trump.

&gt;""Epstein's lawyers synopsized and quoted Trump as saying that Jeffrey Epstein was not a member of his club at Mar-a-Lago, but he was a guest at Mar-a-Lago, and he had never been asked to leave,"" Raskin said. ""That was redacted for some indeterminate, inscrutable reason.""

In early 2006, Trump listed the property for $125 million (over twice what he'd bought it for,) and eventually sold it to a Russian oligarch for $145 million. 

THAT is why they stopped being friends, according to people who knew them. It sounds like Trump was just being the petty bitch he's always been, and shanking an old friend for challenging him on a sleazy real estate deal.

1r1cn0k,vox,"The questions about the exact nature of Donald Trump’s relationship with the late financier and sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein that have dogged his presidency in [both](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/nyregion/trump-ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein.html)[ terms](https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/477622/immigration-epstein-affordability-trump-polling) were given fresh life last week when the Justice Department [released millions of new “Epstein files.”](https://www.vox.com/the-logoff-newsletter-trump/477518/epstein-files-new-release-trump-bannon-lutnick-musk-emails-explained)

But for all that Trump, and any number of other powerful men, would prefer that the ongoing Epstein story go away, its actual political *impact* in the US may end up being limited, relative to the attention the story has gotten. Barring a massive new shoe dropping, Trump will not be forced to resign over Epstein, nor will Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who testified in Congress on Tuesday about having [had lunch on Epstein’s island in 2012](https://www.ft.com/content/500bff5b-fba8-4fcd-a672-762141882441) after previously indicating he’d broken off ties [years earlier](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5731446-lutnick-admits-epstein-island-visit/).

It’s not clear any other high-ranking political figures or [business leaders](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/tech-leaders-epstein-records-silicon-valley-sergey-brin-thiel-sinofsky-reid-hoffman-musk-gates.html) whose names turn up in the files will suffer major consequences either. Other prominent US figures have suffered reputational damage, to be sure, but if the last 30 years of American political life have taught us anything, it’s that [Larry Summers will be back](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/will-creepy-epstein-emails-be-the-end-of-larry-summers.html).

The same cannot be said of every country, however. The world leader most likely to be brought down by the Epstein files is not Trump, but British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The files contain some extremely damaging information about Peter Mandelson, a longtime power player in Starmer’s Labour Party whom he appointed as ambassador to the United States, despite the fact that Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein was already public knowledge.",2026-02-10 20:46:23,reddit
1r1cn0k,vox,"The revelations have thrown the British government into turmoil. Two senior Starmer aides — his chief of staff and his communications director — have already resigned over their roles in Mandelson’s appointment, and a [third is likely on his way out](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/09/top-civil-servant-could-become-third-key-no-10-departure-in-days). On Monday, the leader of Scotland’s Labour Party, Anas Sarwar, became the [most senior figure to call](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/world/head-of-scotlands-labour-party-calls-on-starmer-to-resign) on Starmer to resign. So far, Starmer is [defiantly rejecting calls to step down](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-pm-starmer-says-he-will-never-walk-away-his-mandate-2026-02-10/) and other Cabinet ministers are [rallying around the prime minister](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89kwj8kjy9o), but some highly placed sources reportedly believe [it’s a coin toss](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-08/starmer-s-uk-premiership-teeters-on-brink-after-key-aide-quits?srnd=homepage-americas) whether he remains in power.

““Knowing that the federal government can physically seize and rummage through election records, long after the election has been certified, will predictably chill voter participation and undermine voters’ confidence in the security and secrecy of their ballots,” he said.

Democrats and election officials across the country have monitored the events in Fulton County with apprehension, as some worry that Mr. Trump might direct the Justice Department to search election centers in other cities or counties as well. Elections have long been conducted by state authorities, with minimal involvement from the federal government.”",2026-02-10 20:56:29,reddit

1r1ci22,B-Z_B-S,"(From the article): ""An F.B.I. search warrant affidavit unsealed on Tuesday shows that a criminal investigation into 2020 election results in Fulton County, Ga., was set off by a leading election denier in the Trump administration and relied heavily on claims about ballots that have been widely debunked.

The unsealing of the affidavit in Fulton County is likely to raise more questions about the Trump administration’s use of the F.B.I. and Justice Department to revive old, largely disproved claims about the 2020 election in the state, which President Trump narrowly lost.

“The FBI criminal investigation originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen, Presidentially appointed Director of Election Security and Integrity,” the affidavit said. Mr. Olsen [played a central role](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/kurt-olsen-trump-2020-lawyer.html) in Mr. Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, including speaking to the president multiple times on Jan. 6, 2021. He has continued to push false claims about elections, and was recently appointed to a key role in the Trump administration.

Many of the claims in the affidavit refer to long-held — and consistently debunked — conspiracy theories about elections in Georgia, including arguments about fraudulent and duplicate absent ballots, election machine tabulator tapes and missing ballot images.  

The warrant for the search of an election center in Fulton County, which F.B.I. agents carried out late last month, demanded all physical ballots from the 2020 election, as well as all ballot images, tabulator tapes for Fulton County’s voting machines, and copies of voter rolls from that year.

Robb Pitts, the chair of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, said [at a news conference last week](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/fulton-county-fbi-raid-trump-gabbard.html) that the Justice Department did not give local officials an inventory of what was taken.

“We don’t even have copies of what they took, so it’s a problem,” Mr. Pitts said. The county estimated that the F.B.I. seized 656 boxes of “original documents and records from the 2020 election,” according to its motion to unseal the affidavit. Another official estimated that the number was closer to 700 boxes.""",2026-02-10 20:44:55,reddit

1r1ccqe,brain_overclocked,"The lie:

&gt;Democratic Representative Maxine Waters caught Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a clear and obvious lie during a congressional hearing.

&gt;“Did you write a letter to investors raising concerns about the impact of tariffs, writing that ‘tariffs are inflationary’? Did you say that at that time, yes or no?” Waters asked.

&gt;“Uh, no,” Bessent replied.

&gt;“OK … we have a New York Times article that agrees that you said that,” Waters said.

&gt;“Great, New York Times,” Bessent said, smiling.

&gt;Waters continued:

&gt;“Last summer, when you testified before a Senate committee, you said, and I quote, ‘There is no inflation. Tariffs are not being passed on to consumers.’ You were quite definitive, and even claimed that critics had ‘tariff derangement syndrome,’” she said. “Well, those comments are at odds with the statement you made to investors that tariffs are inflationary.... Are tariffs inflationary? Yes or no?”

&gt;“According to the San Francisco Federal Reserve … tariffs do not cause inflation,” Bessent said.

Bessent's letter:

&gt;Bessent may have very well perjured himself, given the letter he claimed doesn’t exist certainly does. In that January 2024 letter, which Semafor’s Eleanor Mueller first highlighted, Bessent wrote: “Tariffs are inflationary and would strengthen the dollar--hardly a good starting point for a US industrial renaissance.” He then goes on to argue that Trump will weaken the dollar to “make US manufacturing competitive.”

Addendum:

* [America's own goal: Americans pay almost entirely for Trump’s tariffs](https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/news/americas-own-goal-americans-pay-almost-entirely-for-trumps-tariffs/)

&gt;Contrary to US government rhetoric, the cost of US import tariffs are not borne by foreign exporters. Instead, they hit the American economy itself. Importers and consumers in the US bear 96 percent of the tariff burden, according to new research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

* [Trump's tariffs cost American households $1,000 last year: Research group](https://abcnews.com/Business/trumps-tariffs-cost-american-households-1000-year-research/story?id=130003484)

&gt;The cost is set to go even higher this year to $1,300 per household, assuming the existing tariffs stay in place, the research said.

&gt;Following a month where the trade deficit hit its lowest level since early 2009, it shot up to $56.8 billion, an increase of 94.6% from October. Of that gain, about one-third came with the European Union, where the goods deficit rose by $8.2 billion. The goods deficit with China decreased by about $1 billion to $13.9 billion.

&gt;On a year-over-year basis, the deficit through November stood at $839.5 billion, or about 4% higher than the same period in 2024.",2026-02-10 20:57:33,reddit

1r1cazc,Newsweek_CarloV,"From the article:

Senator Jon Ossoff’s ability to thread the needle as a liberal Democrat in conservative Georgia has many Democrats starting to wonder if their 2028 savior might have been under their noses all along.

Often framed as the most vulnerable Democratic senator on the ballot in November, Ossoff is now running as an aggressor, leaning into attacks on President Donald Trump focused on themes of corruption, democratic norms and economic malaise at a moment when Republicans are struggling mightily to retain control of Congress under their leader's sagging polls and self-inflicted political wounds. 

At recent rallies, Ossoff has sharpened his rhetoric, portraying the Trump administration as “the Epstein class,” a phrase meant to recast the election as a fight between everyday Americans and entrenched elites rather than a traditional partisan contest.

At 38, Ossoff is doing more than trying to survive a difficult midterm. He is offering a theory for the 2028 presidential race that is also of the moment: disciplined incumbency paired with selective confrontation can turn vulnerability into leverage. Whether that makes him a national model post-November or simply a well-positioned outlier remains an open question.

It's definitely better to have him at the Capital than a Republican and he hasn't proven himself a complete fool like someone like Fetterman or Sinema has, but in terms of pulling us out of this ditch we are in he is just not the person for the job.

Ossaf is a pramatist. He thinks the way forward is to compromise with the right and work together to get things done. Those words might seem inspiring and when read at face-value could even be construed as noble. But they ignore reality. There is no compromising with people who will just as easily support Fascism to achieve their goals. Ossaf can go maddog on Trump as much as he wants, but the problem is more than Trump. It's even more than Republicans. The neo-con Dems are equally to blame for how our country got to where it is. Democrats inability to fight back against the erosion of social norms that Newt Gingrich began to espouse in the 90s paved the way for an evil person like Trump to get into the White House. You can critcize the errors and mistakes these people have made without reducing that argument down to a stupid both sides argument.

If we want to see things improve, we need major changes. We need a leader who will convince people that those changes are necessary and rally them behind the cause. We do not need someone who is rushing to the center to compromise on solutions. We need someone who will bring the people to them and their plans for a better future.

Progressives are not the populists Moderates want to paint them as. Progressives are idealists. They have a vision for a better future for this country. Moderates are the populists. They bend their talking points to fit what they think polls best, rather than taking command and speaking in a way that changes minds and by proxy the polls.

1r1bm0o,insbordnat,"Two thoughts.

1.  Lutnick is on the ropes, it's time to KO this fool.  He either knew he was lying and needs to be reminded that he perjured himself in a congressional hearing, or if he claims that he doesn't clearly remember and misspoke, he's unfit to be Commerce Secretary given the seriousness and severity of the misstep.  This cannot fade into obscurity.

I find it really hard to believe he just stopped off ""for an hour"" and said ""gotta run"".  I'm sure they got the tour, exchanged pleasantries, and had a more relaxing stay than a quick power lunch.  Maybe the lunch was an hour, but I know how these people operate: he popped the kids some popcorn in the media room/theater, showed off the boats, walked the garden, etc.  Lutnick and Epstein probably had a separate breakout meeting to discuss business while the kids were watching A Bug's Life with Aunty Ghislane. 

2.  Whatever happens from here - our biggest mistake will be diminishing the utter incompetence of this administration, the failings of this president, and forgetting the accomplices/co-conspirators of Trump's cronies.  I'm talking history classes, textbooks, final fucking Jeopardy answers: for generations to come, this administration needs to be the case study of political/constitutional failings, oligarchy, money laundering, and widespread corruption.  Fuck Nixon, Madoff, Enron, and Charles Manson, these are the criminal all-stars that should go down in the history books.  

There needs to be a Warren-esque Commission on this shit show, and we're talking RICO charges brought against every single one of these fuckers.  This is La Cosa Nostra like Mafia shit under the banner of Freedom, Democracy, Capitalism, and Patriotism.  It's a protection racket.  As much as I hate to say it, this country will not heal until those that were supposed to be upholding the rule of law and constitution are are in leg irons and stripes doing the perp walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.

Don't get this wrong, it's not directed at you personally but at the people you are talking about: What they call ""illegals"" are just people who migrated. They are neither better nor worse than the average American. A society that has a social system may find it difficult to handle this kind of migration and may restrict it. But this doesn't make those people evil or dangerous.

The goal can be to prevent this kind of immigration and to pressure people to leave. But putting them in some camps in inhumane conditions and without a well regulated, quick process to deport them, is just despicable, evil shit.

Being a white bloke from a wealthy country shouldn’t give you the option to skip the queue when you feel like it imo.

It seems he’s fighting deportation back to Ireland which is why he’s been stuck in detention for all this time.

I have some concerns about some corner cases, due to the odd definition of 'wireless communication device' (Which doesn't actually need to be wireless, thanks to janky definition)

Specifically, if a school utilizes a PBX system for their internal phones, some models of PBX phones that are completely reasonable to have installed will need to be changed.

I remember in high school, there was a situation where I needed to use the teacher's desk phone to call the school office.  That would technically be banned, should the desk phones be sufficiently customizable (as many of them are).",2026-02-10 20:39:22,reddit

We gotta stop giving up before it’s even started. Newsom is a serious compromise of progressive values. We need something better, something inspiring. Something that can show people a new way CAN work. 

If we keep settling for people like Newsom and Harris, we’re never gonna be rid of the Trump style Republicans.

1r1ah2m,green-wagon,"From the article:  
So far, key facts about Newsom’s policy priorities have scarcely gone beyond California’s borders. “National media have focused on Newsom as a personality and potential White House candidate and have almost completely ignored what he has and has not done as a governor,” said columnist Dan Walters, whose five decades covering California politics included 33 years at the Sacramento Bee. “It’s a perpetual failing of national political media to be more interested in image and gamesmanship rather than actual actions, the sizzle rather than the steak, and Newsom is very adept at exploiting that tendency.”



...Newsom angered climate activists last fall by signing his bill to open up thousands of new oil wells. Noting that “Newsom just championed a plan to dramatically expand oil drilling in California,” the Oil and Gas Action Network said that he “can’t claim climate leadership while giving Big Oil what it wants.” Third Act, founded by Bill McKibben, responded by denouncing “Newsom’s Big Oil backslide” and accused the governor of “backtracking on key climate and community health commitments.”



Efforts to curb the ubiquitous toxic impacts of PFAS “forever chemicals” hit a wall in October when Newsom vetoed legislation to ban them in such consumer items as cookware, dental floss and cleaning products. “This bill had huge support from both within the state and beyond, and yet, apparently, the governor was interested only in the one sector opposing it – the cookware industry,” said Clean Water Action policy director Andria Ventura. The organization put the veto in context, observing that “the governor seems determined to move away from his pro-environment past.”



Newsom has also refused to protect workers’ rights. In 2023, he vetoed a bill to provide unemployment compensation to workers on strike. The following year he vetoed a bill to help protect farmworkers from violations of heat safety regulations, while temperatures in California’s agricultural fields spike above 110 degrees.",2026-02-10 19:29:14,reddit
1r1ah2m,Bakedads,"I'll add that he vetoed a bill last year that would have significantly helped college teachers. He was afraid that the law would have required the state to provide health insurance to the teachers. Just think about that for a moment. He apparently doesn't think teachers deserve health care. The dude is a gross human being, and californians should be ashamed they ever elected him to office.

object protruding through the fence and realized the object was the barrel of a rifle aimed directly at him. The Agent jumped out of the golf cart, drew his weapon, and began backing away. The

1qzgghd,MasterK999,"Clickbait headline from the NY Times. Gross.

The most relevant part:

&gt; Mr. Clinton has said he stopped speaking with Mr. Epstein sometime before his 2006 indictment. In a statement, Angel Ureña, a spokesman for the Clintons, said the former president had “called for the full release of the Epstein files” and “has nothing to hide.”
&gt;
&gt;“He knew nothing about Epstein’s crimes,” Mr. Ureña said. “When it became clear Epstein had no genuine interest in lifesaving philanthropic work, there was no reason for further contact. The facts are the facts and the truth is the truth, and they’re both on our side.”

I think it is most important to realize that no matter what the Clinton's connection to Epstein is was AFTER he was retired from politics. The relationship was only transactional in one direction. Epstein wanted the cachet of appearing to be ""close"" to a former president. Bill had no power or corruption at all on offer.

“I vote with the president 91% of the time. The 9% of the time my party is taking up for pedophiles, bankrupting this country or starting another war, I don’t vote with them,” Massie said. “They want 100% compliance. That’s why they’re trying to take me out.”

""Massie claimed the effort against him was funded by the “Epstein class,” billionaires whose names appear in the case files of Jeffrey Epstein.

Conservatives opposed emancipation of slaves.


Conservatives opposed desegregation.


Conservatives opposed dismantling Jim Crow laws.


Conservatives opposed labor movements.


Conservatives opposed honoring treaties with First Nations peoples.


Conservatives opposed environmental conservation.


Conservatives opposed gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights.


Conservatives opposed consumer protections.


Conservatives opposed education funding.


Conservatives opposed labor protections for minors, immigrants, and the working class exploited via the minimum wage.


Conservatives opposed natal care, childcare, and resources for family planning.

You nailed it.

And because over time liberals moved solidly to the center on most issues, they do much of what traditional conservatives used to do. So modern conservatives can't find ways to differentiate themselves on current policies.

The fundamental position of all Conservative movements across cultures is that they seek to “conserve” and bolster the traditional, established ways of doing things (socially, political, economic, cultural, and religious).  They want the next three generations to do things just like the last three.

When they do try to force dramatic changes, it’s always in the guise of doing it in the name of preserving the “big picture” established ways and values or it’s done with the intent of returning the people to a mythic age of bygone greatness in the past, not building a shiny, progressive future.

1qzfzlw,ChickpeaDemon,"Your party has always taken up for pedos:

&gt;Illinois Rep. Dennis Hastert, who served as Speaker of the House from 1999 to 2007. In 2015, an FBI investigation found that Hastert molested at least four boys during his tenure as a high school teacher and wrestling coach in the 1970s. An additional civil lawsuit alleged that Hastert sodomized a fourth-grade boy in a school bathroom and threatened him if he reported the assault. Since the statute of limitations had expired on these crimes, Hastert was instead convicted of evading bank reporting requirements in order to secretly pay off his victims. He served 15 months in prison. Somehow, this has all but disappeared from our cultural memory. Could our failure to reckon with Hastert’s crimes — and the numerous derelictions of responsibility that let them go unpunished for so long — be one reason why a known pedophile now has a real shot at winning a Senate seat? Yes, probably. 

&gt;Enter Roy Moore, running for Senate despite being accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, with teenage girls, with allegations dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s.

1qzfg7l,AINonsense,Almost as thorough and forensic as their exhaustive investigations into the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.,2026-02-08 17:49:29,reddit
1qzfg7l,TintedApostle,"Almost.

You can tell Trump demanded this.  It is following the pattern and yes he did this also with Kavanuagh.

1) Trump said Russia was a hoax and days before Mueller was to publish his findings Trump said it was over and Barr altered the report.  We all know Trump was involved with Putin and Russia.

2) Trump said the Epstein files was over days before the FBI report and once again his person in charge steps on the results because we all know Trump is involved with child trafficking and rape.  The files are just insanely pointing to him.

Edit:  Ran a prompt comparing how the Mueller report was handled versus the Epstein files

Key Patterns of Handling:

Preemptive Narrative Framing: In both cases, Trump’s allies and administration officials issued summaries or public statements to ""set the stage"" before full documents reached the public.

- Mueller: Attorney General William Barr released a four-page summary weeks before the report, which Trump used to claim ""total exoneration"" despite the report specifically stating it did not exonerate him.

- Epstein: Trump and top officials (like Attorney General Pam Bondi) provided briefings suggesting the files ""absolved"" him or were based on false allegations even as the Justice Department withheld half the records.

Selective Disclosure &amp; Resistance: Trump’s administration has consistently limited the scope of information released to the public or Congress.

- Mueller: Trump made multiple attempts to limit the investigation's scope to ""future elections"" only, effectively trying to block scrutiny of his 2016 campaign.

- Epstein: Despite the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the administration released only ~3.5 million of 6 million documents, sparking claims of a legal violation and a ""mirage of transparency"".

Discrediting the Source: When faced with unfavorable details, Trump often characterizes the investigations as politically motivated attacks.

- Mueller: Labeled the investigation a ""witch hunt"" and an ""illegal takedown"".

- Epstein: Claimed the files were created by political foes and that those requesting them were ""radical left lunatics"".

Public Defiance vs. Private Control: 

- A pattern noted in the Mueller report—where Trump made public attacks while privately attempting to influence or fire investigators—has been echoed in the Epstein saga. He publicly pledged to release the files while his administration was later criticized by judges for appearing to ""divert"" rather than disclose.",2026-02-08 17:54:03,reddit
1qzfg7l,Specialist-Clock-914,"One correction I would make is that Bill Barr didn’t alter Mueller’s report, he completely misled and purposefully misrepresented it before sending out the report. They didn’t need to hide it they just needed to sow enough doubt that his supporters would be like “fake news” to everything after that. This time they’re really trying to hide everything they can.",2026-02-08 18:05:59,reddit
1qzfg7l,TintedApostle,"Former White House Counsel Don McGahn is a “credible witness” in providing evidence that Trump indeed attempted to fire Mueller. This “would qualify as an obstructive act” if the firing “would naturally obstruct the investigation and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.”

Trump’s effort to force Sessions to confine the investigation to only investigating future election interference “would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the investigation and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.” “Taken together, the President’s directives indicate that Sessions was being instructed to tell the Special Counsel to end the existing investigation into the President and his campaign.”

Despite the report's conclusion, Mueller has explained that there were numerous links between the Trump campaign and the Russians, and that several people connected to the campaign lied to Mueller's team and tried to obstruct the investigation into the Trump campaign's contacts and communications with the Russians.",2026-02-08 19:06:55,reddit
1qzfg7l,AINonsense,"&gt; Bill Barr didn’t alter Mueller’s report

He added an entirely misleading 'summary' and 'summarised' it in a letter to Congress 'introducing' the report.

&gt; [The actual text of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report tells a very different story than what was in summaries produced by Attorney General William Barr in letters to Congress and in a press conference prior to the report’s release. A comparison of the report and Barr’s statements shows that Barr downplayed Mueller’s findings about Russian contacts with Trump campaign associates as well as the damning evidence of the president’s obstruction of justice that Mueller assembled.] (https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/stark-contrasts-between-the-mueller-report-and-attorney-general-barrs-summary/)",2026-02-08 20:04:16,reddit

The GOP has already shown us their resolve in protecting the abusers, hiding the worst of the pedos, deflecting disclosures of the files - at every turn, every opportunity. When there have been efforts to enforce the Epstein Files Transparency Act, who opposed them? Who voted against every attempt to obtain them? 

We all know who! The only way to see justice served in these matters is to overwhelmingly defeat those GOPs who obstructed justice and who chose to protect the pedophiles and child rapists, at the ballot box.

Also, let's be real...Harris was a garbage-tier candidate we were desperately trying to prop up with money because there was no way for us donors to get a stronger candidate no matter what--any shifts were entirely in the party's hands.

There always has to be a group of people doing the work, and getting less than they put in out of it.

They're trying to claw it back now, and re-establish a neo-feudal state because they don't think the working class still needs to be educated to give the elite what they want. Eventually though, that falls apart. Unless we de-grow our civilization slowly enough that people forget to be educated, it isn't possible to put that genie back in the bottle.

Providing health insurance to undocumented immigrants is morally good, but if you are such a heartless person that you only care about the financial side of things, it's fiscally responsible, too. Undocumented immigrants who get sick will instead go to hospitals where they are guaranteed care whether they can pay or not. That debt, when it goes unpaid, gets sold to collections, and it ends up raising prices. We all end up paying for it in the form of cost shifting.

The worse republicans get while out of office, the better they do.  It naturally leads dems to conclude  ""Maybe opposing these policies is a losing strategy and we only win due to vibes when Republicans have a .majority.""


I'm not sure they're even wrong, to be honest.    If we want the country to move - and I mean really move - to the left, we need more sustained dem victories, because we need to demonstrate that moving to the right is a losing strategy for politicians even when vibes are bad and they have 49% of the political power as opposed to 51% (which is a very real threshold that does make a difference to millions of people in ascribing blame).   We need more mamdani and AOC wins.   We need leftists to reflect on why they can't win primaries vs other dems instead of why they're not on the general ballot against Republicans and staying home.

1qzdhzc,Shadpool,"Bondi was Florida’s AG and chose not to investigate Epstein despite lawsuits from his victims. Barry Krischer, attorney for the state, was the prosecutor in Epstein’s prostitution case, and had two underage girls tell him that Epstein solicited them. Krischer told the girls that they were the criminals.

Alex Acosta negotiated the plea deal for Epstein. Later on, Trump tapped Acosta to be the Secretary of Labor.

One of Acosta’s first acts was to cut funding to the Department of Labor’s International Labor Affairs Bureau, which combats human trafficking, including child sex trafficking.

🤔

When Epstein was arrested in 2019, and the history of Acosta’s involvement with Epstein came out, Acosta’s resigned amidst public outcry. Trump stood next to him at his resignation and called him a “*great, great secretary.*”

It is the policy of the administration to treat NDAs as the highest order of the law and the only law to supersede the US Constitution.

It was unremarkable, it's what he ate for breakfast. He didn't even bother to try to hide it unless he was facing legal inquiries. 

And hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors to his properties saw these clearly underage girls hanging out all over the place without their families or any other plausible reason for being there. The sexual use of these girls was completely obvious, on full display. All these people who saw, even if they didn't participate, did nothing to stop it. Even if they thought it was strange or alarming, they were willing to normalize it, to turn a blind eye to maintain the relationships Epstein provided or to avoid getting embroiled in the legal/reputational disaster that would surely follow any whistleblowing. 

I doubt anybody in Epstein's social circle who witnessed this -- whether or not they found his predilections unsavory -- saw them as IMPORTANT, compared to the web of money, power, and influence he was working.

It's not, because the reason is instead birth control, freedoms, and equality and independence for women. Some amount education yes (which I didn't complain about when you said, because that part was valid), but a large amount of the education is learning about freedoms and equality etc...

&gt; A lot of poor countries have starving children and do you honestly think majority of Americans are okay with that??? Have babies and just worry about their upbringing later?

Yes an American born into that scenario would do the same, because it isn't a matter of being okay with it.

1qzclhl,Faokes,"In San Jose, CA, there is one of the only remaining original “Japan towns,” where Japanese immigrants lived and built culture together before internment. The reason the one in San Jose survived through internment is because they found just a few trustworthy white men to help them. Those men either assumed ownership of the buildings, or held up the ownership of them in court proceedings until the Japanese Americans were released. Then they returned the properties to their rightful owners. If you check the website for the Buddhist temple there, they actually mention, “A compassionate attorney, J.D. Peckham, took care of the temple during these trying years even going so far as to patrol the grounds himself.”

As a transgender American, I have already asked some trusted people to do the same for my property, should I ever be put in a camp. My friends who are Mexican immigrants have done similar.

What congressional mechanic does he have available to put up a more meaningful fight?   Or do you just want speeches and protests?

If student debt was on his agenda it would all be forgiven before midnight tonight and in several years we’d get a court ruling that it was illegal but there’s nothing we can do about it now, or a ruling from SCOTUS that actually the Founders always intended the president to have plenary authority over student debt.

Biden dipped his pinky toe into maybe possibly forgiving a partial, flat amount per person of all student debt held by the executive branch Dept of Education.

1qzcgg3,theatlantic,"Idrees Kalhoon: “There is an irony to the undying Jeffrey Epstein scandal: It may never be more than an annoyance for President Trump, who knew Epstein well, but it could topple British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who never met the sex-offender financier. Starmer has a 71 percent disapproval rating and leads the least popular British government since World War II. The reasons for the Labour Party leader’s deepening plight are moral, because decency and shame still matter in British politics. But they are also institutional. An American president is less democratically accountable than the British prime minister, because partisanship has disabled the checks that the Founders placed on the chief executive.

“Starmer’s troubles stem from appointing Peter Mandelson, a Labour politician known as the ‘Prince of Darkness,’ to be his ambassador to the United States. Mandelson was long known to have been friendly to Epstein but got the job anyway, replacing Karen Pierce, an effective career diplomat with warm ties to MAGA-land who did not particularly want to leave. Mandelson’s term lasted only eight months, ending in September when it was revealed that he was even closer to Epstein than previously realized. He had expressed fury at Epstein’s prosecution for sex crimes in a Florida court in 2008, writing to Epstein, ‘I think the world of you.’ …

“But the revelations contained in the tranche of 3.5 million files released late last month by the Justice Department worsened the crisis. The records seem to show Mandelson giving Epstein confidential information about the European Union’s bailout. They show direct payments for unspecified purposes from Epstein to Mandelson and his now-husband (Mandelson has said he has no recollection of receiving the money). There is even a photo of Mandelson in his underwear. This is Mandelson’s third disgraceful exit from public life over his long political career, but it appears to be his final one. He is no longer a member of the privy council (which advises the king), the House of Lords, or the Labour Party. But even such a thorough torching of Mandelson’s political career might not be enough to save Starmer’s …

“The contrast with America is striking. For many American political figures, having palled around with Epstein is barely grounds for embarrassment … Two billionaires in Trump’s orbit—Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, and Elon Musk, the Republican super-donor and onetime special government employee—both shrugged off correspondence showing plans to visit Epstein on his island years after his conviction.

“The United States is supposed to be a puritanical country in comparison with godless Europe, but in reality it is so saturated in scandal that new ones elicit little outrage. A single dodgy ambassador—Trump has appointed many, almost all unnoticed by the public—could hardly bring down a presidency.”

Here’s my go at:

&gt; It looks like someone at the very top of U.S. intelligence (Gabbard and team) put their ""thumb on the scale"" when information showed up that could politically embarrass or endanger Donald Trump or someone close to him. And we don't even know what that information was, but given their actions, it's probably not great. This matters because whistleblower laws were not followed, and Congress was not able to evaluate the claim in a timely manner. This is clearly a move to discourage whistleblowers, and hide possibly damaging information from ever reaching the public.

Of course, the other problem could be that nobody has confidence Congress would do anything about it, even if they did get the whistleblower claim in a timely manner. Congress has basically made itself irrelevant in the Trump era.",2026-02-08 17:59:13,reddit

1qzccpi,manfromfuture,"Assuming Russia's goal is (1) US out of NATO and (2) weakening the cohesiveness of the United States (possibly to the point of breaking up)



Let's make a list of how Trump is helping:

* Threatening to invade Greenland. Destroying US relationships with NATO because he would need a constitutional amendment to fully pull out of NATO. 


* Cutting funding and federally funded projects to blue states or states that have democrat Governors.


* Refusing to provide disaster relief funds which undermines people's confidence in the federal government. Destroying the social safety nets using executive orders. 


* Weakening the US government through executive orders and things like DOGE, including law enforcement and the clandestine services. Losing the expertise of the most experienced employees.


* Closing USAID. It was said that every dime spent on USAID saved one dollar on bullets. It was the best kind of foreign influence. 


* Helping to convince people not to get vaccinated which puts the US at risk for biological attacks, especially the Military. Make drugs unaffordable and unavailable.


* Pulling the US out of the World Health Organization, another way to drive a wedge with allies. No legit explanation for this.


* Executive Actions Targeting Colleges and Universities which in the long term puts the US at a disadvantage technology and competitively. 


* Finding excuses to send federal agents and the national guard to blue states. Doing nothing when they kill people which further destroys public trust in the US government. 


* Trying to fire the head of the FED so he can cut interest rates while there seems to be a huge AI related bubble in the stock market, possibly worse than 2008.",2026-02-08 17:28:43,reddit

1qzccpi,W4r1s,"I am by no means pro Trump, but there are levels to this. It more seems like Trump floods the information space with things, and sees what resonates with the media, and therefor his support base. Some of his supporters are pro-russian (be it bought off or actual ideologs), but not all, especially not all of his advisors or Senators/Congressmen.

If you pardon my crude analogy, he is behaving like a bull in a China shop, but he could be a magnitude 9 earthquake.  
He could:  
\- Unilateraly pull out of NATO. With congress as lame as it is, I doubt there would be much resistance quick enough for it to really materialize. Even if that does not pan out or gets blocked somehow, actually pull the trigger in invading an allied countrys territory. (E.g. Greenland (Denmark) or some of the Dutch islands in the carribean (Curacao, Aruba or Saint Maarten))  
\- Pull out of all of foreign conflicts, or at least the ones in the Middle East/Mediteranian. Bombing Iran and the current posturing in the Persian Gulf has significantly weakened an ally of Russia, not strengthened.  
\- Actually stop selling the weapons to Europeans to give to the Ukrainians, or stop maintenance/resupply of those weapons.  
\- Encourage or at least not actively hinder the use of american technology by Russia. (Starlink shutting down for russians is the exact opposite of that, and appareantly a massive hinderance for the russian offensive)

Right now it feels more like some of his closest advisors are in a shouting match, all trying to get Trumps attention. And, as Trump has no filters or really much of a goal other than enriching himself and ""legacy building"", he just follows all of these impulses: Venezuela seems to have been Rubios goal, Greenland and ICE seems to mostly be Millers, pulling out of the WHO is probably on Trump himself as well as on Kennedy. USAID, at least from my point of view, weridly feels like Musk had his fair share in destroying. All of these can be seen as actions taken under the umbrella of ""small government"" or ""pulling out of foreign entanglements"", but there seem to be weirdly personal reasons behind these actions.

Trump is obsessed with ""making history"". With being in a league with great presidents of the past. Enlarging the country with an area rivaling the Louisiana or Alaska purchases would, at least in his mind, achieve that. But, if he can't have that, at least he will have a monument to his hubris in Washington, be it that Ballroom or some weird Arc de Triomphe. Or at least a parade in his honors.

1qzcbwf,gwsth,"My point still stands regardless of how you categorize the voters.

If she's running on a platform of throwing the election to Trump, that means that she feels that 51% of potential voters in both the primary and the general are going to support this.  Again, you don't run your campaign on losing issues.   

The fact that it's a GOP-only primary is not relevant.  First, it still would mean that at least 51% of the GOP are perfectly OK with throwing elections (which is a very, very likely possibility).  Which means we are still well and truly fucked.  Second, she also knows that her support for this issue is going to spill over to the general election.   It's not like centrist and Democrat voters are going to magically forget she spent her primary campaign supporting this.  

And she's still running on it.  Which means she feels that being hammered with this issue by Democrats and centrists in the general won't hurt her chances.  

Which leads to the point I was making all along.  She feels that in the end, 51% of voters will support her on this or she wouldn't be running on it.  You don't run campaigns on losing issues at any step of the process, because your opponents *will* bludgeon you to death with it at some point.  

And I'm not saying she's right, mind you.  She could either lose in a landslide in the general or be laughed out of the primary because of her position on this issue.  I'm just saying that at this point, she feels that campaigning on this issue knowing full well it could be used against her later is still a winning tactic.  And she may not actually be wrong.

Yeah - I'm a progressive but I think we need to go all out to stop the Republicans.  Many of my fellow progressives confuse holding our elected officials accountable with not going all out against those who are fundamentally much worse - I just don't think both siderism is appropriate at this time.  I guess some of that is because I grew up in the South.  I remember thinking ""thank God these people are not running things"".  Now they are.  There was going to be a backlash against the first black president of the United States.  I underestimated how bad it would be but some of my friends predicted it.

1qzc5es,eorlingas_riders,"Doesn’t this statement emphasis OPs statement more?

Harris didn’t embrace genocide, and phrasing it that way does nothing but incite division amongst democrats.

You can disagree with the funding of Israel, and want a more progressive candidate that runs on a platform of reducing, ending that.

But there is a chasm between maintaining funding for a regional power that has been essentially funded entirely, especially militaristically by the US since the 60’s and “embracing genocide”.

Statements like this is one of the contributing factors to what lead to democrats weaker turnout in 2024.  Because a moral purity test was required to support a candidate, and if they weren’t 100% aligned with your position, they didn’t get the vote. Even when the alternative was far worse.",2026-02-08 17:58:04,reddit
1qzc5es,PTechNM,"She could have easily advocated for supporting Israel while simultaneously calling for an end to the killing — proposing a ceasefire that acknowledged both humanity and accountability. But she didn’t. She chose silence, bound by loyalty to Israel and AIPAC. And yes, turnout suffered because she aligned herself with a policy of mass suffering. Her digital presence was weak, her message uninspired, and she bought into corporate media narratives just as public sentiment began to shift against them.

I’m exhausted by the Democrats’ incrementalism and the hollow moral posture of the “West.” Refusing to name injustice for what it is only sustains brutality. Neoliberal gestures — like putting body cameras on ICE agents instead of dismantling a cruel system — are empty. MAGA pushes for martial law in blue cities, and our response is to ask for martial law–lite.

Let’s start from shared truths: genocide is wrong. Patriarchy is outdated and holds back progress. Hatred — whether directed at LGBTQ people, Muslims, Jews, migrants, or Haitians — is wrong. And the state has no place governing people’s bodies. This moral confusion is what happens when a nation refuses to confront its original sins — the genocide of Indigenous people, slavery, and systemic oppression. Failing to reconcile with those demons leaves space for the opposite vision to take hold — and that’s exactly what MAGA represents.",2026-02-08 18:21:37,reddit
1qzc5es,eorlingas_riders,"Yeah, she could have done a lot.  But that wasn’t my critique on your statement.  It was that you said “Harris embraced genocide”.

I agree that her middling approach was not great, and I personally support a full defunding of Israel. But again, a middling approach is not embracing genocide and to create that false dichotomy does nothing but sow division.

Your shared truths are all true, and I think everyone should agree.  But the reality of the world is not that clear. 

Many support aspects of what you said while others do not, even within similarly impacted groups.  Christian, Muslims, and Jews can all agree with what you say, then also vote against any LGBTQ legislation because it’s against religious beliefs. Can you convince a diehard Christian to vote to support abortion?  What if they tell you abortion embraces infant murder?  What is your counter proposition there.

You try and frame these morally superior positions as simple truths or black and white arguments. And while they can be argued that way, people are more complex than that, and the political spectrum by extension is.

I think we’re largely on the same side of all these topics, but your matter of fact stance on complex topics, false dichotomy, and general putting down of political nuance detracts me from supporting your messaging.",2026-02-08 19:09:55,reddit
1qzc5es,blazesquall,I don't get it. When you're in a position materially supporting a genocide and you don't pull the lever to stop it.. it kinda feels like you're allowing it. That's not middling.,2026-02-09 00:42:40,reddit
1qzc5es,eorlingas_riders,"Congress allocates the funding for foreign spending, not the president or vice president. So there’s no lever for the president or vice president to pull, to remove that spending.

The bulk of that funding is via a 10 year “Memorandum of Understanding” which is set to run through 2028. So Israel is going to be funded through 2028 without another act of congress.

So when you say, “materially supporting a genocide”, you mean congress.


The op said:
&gt;She could have easily advocated for supporting Israel while simultaneously calling for an end to the killing — proposing a ceasefire that acknowledged both humanity and accountability 

But she did do that.  She affirmed support for Israel, while also publicly not agreeing with what they were doing.

So Harris didn’t “embrace genocide”, and using that phrasing is incorrect and created an extreme division amongst democrats that contributed to their loss.

But, I wonder if those that think harris supported genocide, and were critical of her at a materially important moment feel like they “embraced Trump”.  

Because there were only two choices at that time, so lack of support for one, was support for the other, and that’s what their criticality of Harris did at that moment. They embraced Trump, and I hope it’s working out for them now.

1qzc5es,md4024,"I agree to an extent. It was a mistake for Harris to campaign with Liz Cheney, probably the biggest mistake they made. But it’s just not true to say Kamala ignored the working class and people of color, just like it was not true to say Hillary Clinton did the same in 2016. Harris did not change her positions or tack towards the center at all to gain the support of Liz Cheney. The message her campaign was trying to send with that was that Trump is so extreme that even someone like Liz Cheney would openly campaign and vote for his opponent, they made that very clear. 

Again, the campaign should have known that message really doesn’t appeal to anyone who might actually vote for Harris, and it shouldn’t have required hindsight to see that. Many people called it out in real time and were ignored. But that doesn’t mean Kamala betrayed the working class or abandoned any part her base.

Kamala Harris was forced into an extremely difficult and unprecedented situation. That’s not an excuse for all of her campaign’s mistakes, but it should buy her at least some leeway. You can wish that she took a stronger stance on Gaza without jumping right to the idea that she is putting the interests of her Jewish overlords over the interests of Americans. 

It’s not entirely on progressives to keep the left united, but the establishment regularly makes concessions and extends olive branches to the left flank of the party. And it seems like progressives are still entirely unwilling to extend the same courtesy, too many of us refuse to accept that Democratic leadership is actually doing what they think is best, even if we don’t always agree.

So when Newsom comes out against the wealth tax in California, he specifically points out that it needs to help people more broadly (and cites teachers and nurses etc). 

But the progressives lean too hard into helping the poorest of the poor ***only***. Which isn't wrong and hey, it's really good optics, right? 

When it comes time to vote, you are going to need those teachers and nurses too, right? You can't just expect them to vote blue because it's ""the right thing to do"". You have to do stuff for them too. 

Does that make sense?",2026-02-08 17:59:23,reddit
1qzc5es,_bk_adv,"Reading these comments, it’s clear that once again democratic voters are gonna drop the ball and not show up. Hope all you idiots are prepared for 4 more years of MAGA bullshit. 

Pathetic. I too wish we lived in a perfect society where the perfect candidate gets nominated, but that’s not the world we live in. I’m not the biggest Newsom fan either but if it’s him then fuck it, it’s him. 

I’m sick and tired of settling for mediocre democrat candidates also but the alternative is FAR worse. We’re literally living it. Have you all learned nothing?

MAGA republicans rally behind their leading candidates and they win because of it. Democrats are going to have to match that energy and do the same. All the anti-Kamala democrats that disliked her are largely responsible for the mess we are in now. The DNC has made it clear that we don’t truly get to pick — they do. They are going to push Newsom. So either rally behind that or GTFO.

1qzc5es,OberynDantes,"&gt;The DNC has made it clear that we don't truly get to pick - they do.&lt;

The DNC is the bad actor. I’m tired of people assuming that leftists will all just sit out if they don’t like the candidate. You are correct that happened in 2024, but I think there is a fallacy in assuming they will do the exact same thing again if they don’t like the candidate in 2028.

I am all for fostering some level of solidarity amongst all the factions under the “big tent” that votes Democrat. I agree that whomever is the leading non-Republican needs to get support regardless of whether they are someone’s “perfect” candidate. 

But I strenuously object to people that make it seem like it’s wrong to be critical of a potential candidate before anyone has even formally declared they are going for the nomination. That’s also part of the bad behavior that helped get us into the mess we are in.

1qzby3o,Massive_General_8629,"The Republican Party is a tragedy.

Lincoln's GOP was borderlline Marxist, but then in the Gilded Age, they moved in a rightward direction.

That meant they could be straight up blamed for the Great Depression. (And notice Trump is making every mistake Hoover made.)

Now, they *could* moderate their views after that, as Eisenhower did, but then came Goldwater, who acknowledged his economic views were extremist. Goldwater actually won the primary because he was strait-laced, in contrast to Rockefeller who remarried shortly after his divorce. Everyone knew Goldwater's policies would be a disaster, but the South voted for him because his policies would hurt black people more. Weaponized sadism.

So Nixon got the racists. (I mean, those Wallace didn't poach.) But Nixon was a criminal, which led to Carter.

And then we get Reagan. Reagan was charismatic, but I can't help but feel he also had foreign (specifically Iranian) help. In addition, well, let's put it this way: You know how I said Goldwater was an extremist? Goldwater couldn't stand this new generation of religious conservatives, for whom every debate was the Apocalypse.

Clinton tried to get along with the Republicans. He extended a hand and they bit it off.

And that brings us to Bush, who was really the GOP's final attempt to cope with shifting demographics. He spoke Spanish, he actually had black people on his campaign teams and won the greatest percentage of the black vote since Eisenhower. In fact, were it not for the Iraq invasion, ""random"" screenings, and DHS, he'd probably remembered well, and there would be a place for minority conservatives within the GOP.

1qzbxye,sdb00913,"They’re “okay” if you’re in their “tribe.” And their tribe is straight, white, Christianized (not necessarily believers, but they’ve adopted it as the civil religion), and blue collar. 

Here’s the thing: it creates this dynamic where they convince themselves that they’re among the kindest people in the world. Because they are so impoverished and isolated, they retreat to in-group dynamics and focus on the survival and purity of the tribe. They’re reasonably kind to people they know and accept. And nobody else goes out to where they live, at least not for any length of time that could cause a shift in the mindset, and so nothing challenges them to get outside their comfort zone.

But if you’re outside of the tribe? You are to be viewed with suspicion at best, and as an invader or a saboteur at worst. When everything is considered a struggle for survival because their lives are so fragile (and if you’re MAGA, I don’t mean your body is fragile), anything that threatens the unity and purity of the tribe is a threat to the survival of the tribe. That’s why the Great Replacement Theory, illegitimate and ignorant and hateful as it is, “sells” so well out there.

And because of this, they’re not going to listen to anyone who isn’t one of them. But if someone who was “one of them” speaks out, that threatens the purity of the tribe. And that is dangerous to the speaker. 

The more cosmopolitan America operates from a completely different sociological “operating system” than rural America. We as a nation would do well to understand that so we can address it accordingly. I lived it and got out of it, and so I understand it differently than those on the outside looking in.

Edit: just for clarification, like if you’re Black and you passed through my hometown and your car broke down right outside it, people would probably be willing to help you out, or at least they would be unlikely to intentionally do you harm. But if you were to try to move there, you’re gonna have a hard life, especially if you and one of the villagers catch feelings for each other. And that’s how they convince themselves they’re okay, because “I don’t care what color skin you have, if your car breaks down, I’ll give you a ride,” but these are the same people that will throw around the N-word with a hard r.

I don't see how someone can consider themselves so informed while committing the basic error of speaking about rural America as if it's a monolith. 

&gt;They’re “okay” if you’re in their “tribe.” And their tribe is straight, white, Christianized (not necessarily believers, but they’ve adopted it as the civil religion), and blue collar. 

I live in remote Alaska, in one of the most rural areas of the United States, and this couldn't be farther from my experience. 

Sure, there are some similarities in tribal culture, but rural Alaska is highly indigenous and our political behaviors reflect our Eskimo* cultural tradition. 

Alaskan indigenous voters often prioritize subsistence rights, climate change impacts, and federal/state funding for rural infrastructure and healthcare. 

While we may hold socially conservative views in some respects, these regions have been instrumental in electing Democratic candidates, such as U.S. Representative Mary Peltola. In the 2024 presidential election, while the state went to Donald Trump, much of rural Alaska voted for Kamala Harris.

We saw him lusting over his own daughter.  
  
We saw him claiming Obama wasn't a natural born citizen.

We saw him mocking the disabled and saying he could just ""grab 'em by the pussy.""

We saw him fuck up the response to a global pandemic.

We saw him attempt to violate the Constitution and attempt to stay in power with an insurrection and coup after losing a free and fair election.

We saw him steal classified documents and get 34 criminal convictions for document fraud trying to cover up an affair.

We saw him get found liable for fraud, defamation, and sexual battery (i.e. rape.)  
  
We saw him stand on stage before an audience of millions and lie about ""immigrants eating pets.""

We are all on the same team, but the people who accept controlled opposition that the DNC offers up as candidates are doing just as much harm as the emboldened bigots.

You need to raise children the right way from the very beginning or you better be willing to accept responsibility for their actions. Our government neglected its responsibility to ensure that all children are raised in a safe and nurturing environment. 

The government chose to respond to the consequences with tough on crime policy, mass incarceration, and a war on terror. We all know these policies are what put our country in debt, why couldn't they have simply given poor children a better shot at life with those trillions of dollars?

If you grew up in the hell that most of MAGA and the homophobic urban population grew up in you would better understand my point. We cannot allow toxic subcultures to exist and still call ourselves a great nation. 

The one thing that brought me around to rejecting toxic masculinity and accepting my sexuality as not quite straight was realizing that I got my most toxic traits from abusers and being judged and loathed by politically correct people who do not understand what I had been through just made it worse.

When MAGA rages against the ""liberal elite"" they are blaming America's comfortable middle class for the damage that is done by billionaires. All they can see from the housing projects or trailer parks is mostly ""rich"" white people who go to college and live comfortable lives while scolding them for being ignorant savages.

That 'otherness' can be used as vitriol induced wedges; which is actually on display right now given that my comment has been downvoted out of view and you think I'm some sort of instigating plant operative.

I'm sorry you believe that, I don't know what, if anything, I could say to change your mind. Make no mistake though, I am on your side; and my position was simple:

I am not defending someone 'because' they are LGBTQ+ I'm defending them because they are another person; and that's all the reason I need. If you took the label out, and swapped it with another label of another subgroup, it still shouldn't matter; they should be defended for their innate humanity.

1qzb83w,ObstreperousOverture,"I recognize that; and among those nuanced things of the universe are some very determined, very evil, monsters; dead set on conjuring up as much division within our coalition as possible and one of the many, many tools they wield is labels applied at the right time and the right way.

It seems a lot of people in the coalition don't actually understand what it is to be a community with people who see the world differently. Its not easy as they pretend it is and they get very angry if you point that out. Our differences, as a community, are our greatest strength, but they are also our greatest weakness. It is VERY easy, as human beings, for any of us, in our overwhelming sense of righteousness in this moment to go from ""I don't like your opinion"" to ""you're trying to destroy the movement and us with it!!""

If you need proof, cancel culture and litmus testing exist; and both in moderation have value, and both in extremes are reactionary and unhelpful. If you stop people from infiltrating the movement because they can't even manage the barest of minimums of supporting the general direction of the movement and what it stands for, that's a good thing. If you use it as a weapon to shut out anyone who disagrees or has a nuanced perspective; well you're shutting down allies.

So you're right, there is nuance in the world, and that's why people will sometimes dislike what I have to say, because it throws a little cold water on the fire they're trying to wield; so that they don't get burned by their own thought processes, which unfortunately include that I am some sort of saboteur, because how dare I tell them that they are important, but not 'special'?",2026-02-09 14:24:43,reddit

We did have a two-term Democratic governor from 2015-2023, but things lined up for him really well. For one he’s a very, very moderate Dem, and he ran against two absolutely god awful candidates. I don’t see us electing another Democrat to a statewide office anytime soon, if ever. 

New Orleans is a progressive enclave that always votes at least 85% Democrat in presidential elections. 

Other areas with large black populations will likely vote Dem too, but that’s about it.",2026-02-09 04:52:45,reddit

1qzac5l,CuidadDeVados,"I'm going to be reposting this on every Daily Beast article I see on this sub until they are banned for being a bullshit rag with no integrity and decades of associations with sex criminals. 

I swear the Daily Beast should be immediately shuttered and all of its employees sent to prison. They do more damage to the legitimacy of shit than they would ever admit. They use bullshit clickbait headlines to focus on completely irrelevant shit that they know is irrelevant to placate centrists, suburbanites, and liberals before they figure out how fucked up shit is and how no one is coming to save them. 

Want to talk about sex crimes? The founder of the daily beast, Tine Brown served on boards formed by Harvey Weinstein. The person who replaced her as editor, John Avlon, was a speech writer for Rudy Giuliani. The person after that was editor went on to work for Rolling Stone, when they did the following:

&gt;In October 2022, Rolling Stone broke the news that the FBI had raided the home of ABC News producer James Gordon Meek, but left out the detail that the raid was carried out because of child pornography, instead suggesting that ""Meek appears to be on the wrong side of the national-security apparatus"" and that the raid had been instigated by the government because of Meek's reporting on national security issues. It was later revealed that the article was originally to include the child pornography details, but Shachtman, who personally knows the accused Meek and is considered friendly with him, had personally intervened to remove the charges and rewrote the article to give it a different spin.

The editor that replaced him, Tracy Connor, has since moved on to be the editor for Business Insider in 2024 when they decided to shift to producing AI slop articles alongside actual writing. In 2024 she left and was replaced by Hugh Dougherty, who was an editor at the NY Post and the Daily Mail for a combined 8 years. So the magazine has a history of editors with direct associations to sex criminals at very high levels, and when they got rid of the sex criminals they replaced them with fascist propagandists. 

The Daily Beast was sold to a Barry Diller company in the 2010s. Barry Diller is a business and personal associate of fascist propagandist Rupert Murdoch.

Now go and look at the headlines and articles the Daily Beast runs. Sensationalized bullshit. This isn't a real headline. The obvious reality of this headline is that someone put the wrong date in for a press release they didn't plan on making. Shit fucking happens, it was released early in the morning on a Saturday. Notice that every unsubstantiated accusation in the documents from months and years after Epstein's death gets a headline. 

What doesn't get a headline? Maybe go and see how many times Barry Diller appears in the Epstein Files. Or Tina Brown. 

[Tina Brown, founder of the Daily Beast.](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02421873.pdf) after Epstein was convicted of child sex trafficking. That is Epstein trying to meet with her and the issue being the purpose of the meeting and time, not the child sex crimes. 

[Here is Barry Diller talking about wanting to take a hike on Epstein's island](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332640.pdf)

And yet our focus is on the obvious bullshit in the files. I wonder why that is? I wonder why mods of this sub have been okay for years with the Daily Beast's attempt to pacify anyone to the left of fascists and to the right of democratic socialists despite it being a Murdoch rag run by sex criminals?",2026-02-08 17:21:50,reddit

1qza4db,RecursiveSubroutine,"&gt; Many of the Maine residents arrested during an immigration enforcement operation last month were processed at a facility in Massachusetts that attorneys warn has deplorable conditions and is not set up for extended detention.      

&gt; When Immigration and Customs Enforcement pulled all of its detainees out of the Cumberland County Jail, many of them were moved to a field office in Burlington, Massachusetts, about 100 miles from Portland.         

&gt; The facility is designed for administrative processing, but immigration attorneys say it has been holding some people for more than 10 days, raising concerns about due process and access to legal counsel.       

&gt; Lisa Parisio, policy director at the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, said her organization learned the facility was “heavily” used during what ICE called “Operation Catch of the Day” and is deeply alarmed by reports about the conditions there, including overcrowding and lack of access to medication.     

&gt; Attorneys throughout Maine and Massachusetts told the Sun Journal they’ve heard stories of as many as 50 people to a cell — men and women in some cases — with no windows and limited airflow, a single camera-monitored toilet, aluminum blankets, no showers and poor quality food.

Ivana's father was an asset to Soviet sattelite state Czechoslovokia intelligence services, and was providing regular updates to intelligence services about Ivana and Donald's life and businesses in NY.  Intelligence surveillance on Trump started when he married Ivana in 1977.


A Soviet era document showing the KGB was wanting to cultivate ambitious, exploitable businessmen in NY as assets.  A KGB spotter agent looking for people like this did business with Trump.


Real estate deals laundering money for Russian oligarchs.


Selling real estate to Russian Oligarchs for tens of millions more than he bought it for.


After many bankruptcies, nobody would lend him money, except for Deutsche Bank, who was laundering billions for Russian oligarchs.


Repeated direct bailouts by Russian/Soviet investors when he was in financial trouble. 


Various business deals with Russian oligarchs, such as partnering with Agalarov to host the miss universe pageant in Moscow.


And Russian intelligence is very recently in direct contact with his inner circle, according to new information this week




So we have someone with ties to Soviet/Russian intelligence and oligarchs going back 40 years, who parrots Kremlin talking points, who would be bankrupt many times over without Russian money, and who seems to be giving Putin exactly what he wants:  a weaker, isolated America, too caught up in infighting, and driving away western allies.

We've been inundated with credible material suggesting that Donald Trump sexually assaulted children. How much worse can you get? I'm not asking that rhetorically. I may just be naive, but blackmail material worse than sexually assaulting a child eludes me. Does the volume or severity of his assaults make it any more earth shatteringly bad? 

Meanwhile we have just as much information on the kompromat Russia supposedly has on him now as we did about a decade ago. Nobody has spoken up, nothing has leaked.

The disclosure was part of the committee’s fifth and final installment of its investigation of the Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.*

Late 1930's German attitudes toward Jews come to mind. Did your study address this directly, and if not are you aware of studies that correlate this last-place syndrome with certain messaging by political groups and distorted media?",2026-02-08 14:19:40,reddit
1qz9158,Cooley_Psych_Colgate,"This is an important question, and one we get often. Our study does not directly test whether “last place” beliefs are produced by intentional messaging campaigns, nor does it allow us to assess the intent behind political rhetoric or media content. We also want to be cautious about drawing direct historical equivalences, because the political and institutional contexts differ in important ways.

That said, we *did* measure participants’ exposure to different news outlets over the 5 waves of data collection for this study (spanning 3 waves before the 2024 election and 2 waves after, about 3 months in total). In principle, this would allow us to examine whether greater exposure to certain media environments is associated with an increased likelihood of perceiving oneself as “last place,” particularly as an election approaches. These analyses are feasible and could speak to *correlational* relationships between media exposure and status perceptions, though they would not establish intent behind the messaging, of course as we are not measuring the messengers/politicians themselves.

More broadly, there is a large literature showing that political messaging and media environments can shape perceptions of threat, relative status, and group competition (e.g., Mutz, 2018 below). Our contribution is to show that the feeling of “last place” itself—regardless of how it emerges—is linked to particular political stances (e.g., alt-right ideology, DEI ban support, and Trump support/voting). Understanding whether and how particular messages amplify these perceptions is an important next step, but one that might require different data, designs, and samples.

So while our study doesn’t directly test manufactured resentment or propaganda, it helps identify the psychological outcome—perceived relative status—that such messaging may be trying to activate.

1qz9158,Cooley_Psych_Colgate,"Right now, we control for gender in our analyses, in part to make the point that the effects we observe generalize across gender. That said, an important next step is to examine whether these effects are moderated by gender — for example, whether they are stronger among men. Evidence of that sort would help us better isolate whether societal conceptions of masculinity, and the pressures attached to them, are potentially playing a causal role.

In follow-up work, we are exploring where these perceptions of relative status come from using more qualitative and interview-based methods with participants who fall into the “last-place” profile. We hope this work will better situate us to think seriously about deradicalization. At present, though, I think it’s important to be transparent that we are still too early in this research line to offer empirically grounded recommendations for deradicalization efforts. That said, rising extremism — and alt-right extremism in particular — along with broader increases in political polarization, were central motivations for why we became interested in these questions in the first place.

This comment also brings to mind foundational work by Case and Deaton on “deaths of despair” (suicide, alcohol-related deaths, and drug overdoses). Their early theorizing emphasized rising rates of these deaths among working-class white men, and they argued that growing despondency in this group reflected broader social and economic breakdowns. That framing received important critiques, particularly for drawing attention away from persistently high rates of deaths of despair among Black and Native American communities. In response, Case and Deaton’s more recent work has shifted to emphasize that these deaths are increasing across multiple racial groups and among women as well.

A similar nuance appears in our own data. Although public discourse often frames these dynamics as concentrated among working-class white men, we do not find that membership in the “last-place–tied” profile among non-Hispanic white Americans is strongly linked to being working class or to having less than a college degree. At least so far, our findings do not suggest that this psychological process is unique to white men, even if it may be more culturally salient or politically mobilized in that group.

Finally, commentators such as Scott Galloway have helped popularize the idea of a broader “crisis of young men,” pointing to the intersection of economic stagnation, social isolation, and technological exploitation as factors that may make some men particularly vulnerable to radicalization and extremist rhetoric. Whether and how these forces intersect with perceptions of relative status is an open empirical question — and one we are working toward answering as we move forward with this research line.

Did their accuracy correlate with their level of dissatisfaction?",2026-02-08 13:58:06,reddit
1qz9158,Cooley_Psych_Colgate,"Great questions.

On accuracy: our data don’t allow us to directly assess how “accurate” non-Hispanic, white Americans are about their personal position in a racial economic hierarchy, because our measure asks participants to think broadly about status (money, education, job prestige, and political power), and there isn’t a single objective benchmark that combines all of those dimensions. Most public data on inequality focuses on one dimension at a time (like income or wealth).

That said, there is strong existing evidence that white Americans, on average, underestimate the degree of racial economic inequality in the U.S. This work—by scholars such as Michael Kraus, Ivy Onyeador, and Jennifer Richeson (among others)—shows that people tend to believe racial groups are much closer in economic standing than they actually are. Narratives of racial progress and motivated reasoning, among other factors, can contribute to this perceived narrowing of gaps between racial/ethnic groups in contemporary times.

In our data, participants generally seem to understand the *direction* of inequality (for example, recognizing that Black and Hispanic Americans are economically disadvantaged relative to white Americans), but the precise ordering and magnitude of differences are harder to map onto objective metrics given how our measure was framed. Notably, higher education does not appear to make non-Hispanic, white Americans meaningfully more accurate in these perceptions, at least from what we can gather from the data we have--if we map perceived patterns of racial economic inequality very roughly onto actual indices of wealth or income inequality, for instance, higher education does not seem to equate to more accuracy.

On dissatisfaction: what matters most in our work is perceived relative standing, not objective accuracy. People who feel “last place” report greater dissatisfaction and different political attitudes regardless of whether that perception aligns cleanly with objective indicators. In other words, it’s the *experience of relative status*—accurate or not—that seems to drive dissatisfaction.

For readers interested in this broader question of inequality misperception, here are a few relevant papers:

1qz9158,Cooley_Psych_Colgate,"Thanks for the question. Our data can’t speak directly to elite intent or messaging strategies. But there *is* a long history of scholarship showing that racial divisions in the U.S. have often functioned—structurally—to weaken class solidarity.

If we wanted to study your question directly, we’d need to clearly define who counts as “elites,” systematically analyze their public messaging, and then examine whether exposure to that messaging is associated with poorer white and Black Americans’ political attitudes and willingness to see each other as potential allies. Even then, we could estimate effects, not intent.

That said, scholars going back to W. E. B. Du Bois have argued that racial hierarchy historically provided poor white Americans with a *“psychological wage”*—a sense of status tied to race—that aligned them more with wealthy white Americans than with poor Black Americans (so interfering with class solidarity). The key insight from this work is not that there was a single coordinated conspiracy, but that systems of racial inequality have repeatedly benefited those at the top by fragmenting potential class-based coalitions.

Our current work builds on this tradition by examining how perceptions of racialized status—like feeling “last place”—shape political behavior today.

It also may be of interest to note that, in prior work we have published on this topic (Cooley et al., 2024), we found that non-Hispanic, white Americans in the “last place” profile are actually the highest in solidarity/identification with their social class (asked with agreement to items like “I feel a close tie with others from \[class they indicated was their own\]) as well as the highest solidarity/identification with white Americans compared to people in the other profiles. Likewise, participants who fell in the “last place” profile were NOT objectively the least educated nor the lowest income. So, it does NOT seem that those who feel “last place” are also those who are objectively poorest, nor are they those who fail to identify with their social class.

1qz9158,Cooley_Psych_Colgate,"This is a great question. We haven’t yet tested whether these effects differ by gender (for example, whether they are stronger among men than women or transgender people). (See also our reply above.)

That said, our samples are balanced on gender in ways that closely mirror the U.S. population of non-Hispanic, white Americans (via intentional sampling), and we statistically control for gender in our models. The fact that the effects still emerge when accounting for gender suggests they are not driven *only* by men.

It would absolutely be possible — and worthwhile — to run additional analyses testing whether gender moderates these effects (that is, whether they are stronger or weaker for some genders than others), and that’s something we could explore in the data we already have to help hone our theorizing as we move forward with this research line.

More broadly, one thing we’ve found across studies is that non-Hispanic, white Americans who feel “last place” are often *not* the most objectively disadvantaged in terms of income or education.

1qz9158,Cooley_Psych_Colgate,"This is a great question. “Last-place aversion” refers to the idea that people are especially motivated to avoid being lowest in status, or in “last place,” and that this can shape attitudes and decisions regarding monetary redistribution (Kuziemko et al., 2014). For example, experiments simulating wealth redistribution show that people who are making about minimum wage tend to be more likely to redistribute money to those slightly above them in status rather than those slightly below, presumably to avoid falling themselves into last place.

In our work, we measured personal relative status both within one’s own racial group (for our samples, this would be non-Hispanic white Americans) and across other salient racial/ethnic groups in U.S. discourse (Black, Asian, and Hispanic Americans). We then applied **latent profile analysis**, a statistical method for identifying common patterns, to see how participants placed themselves and these groups in relative status. Across thousands of non-Hispanic white participants in multiple peer-reviewed studies, we consistently find that about 10% of the sample falls into a “last place” profile—perceiving themselves as either last or tied for last with Black Americans.

Crucially, this perception of relative status predicts alt-right ideology, support for alt-right candidates, support for DEI bans, support for President Trump in particular, and even actual votes cast for him in the 2024 election. Our theory is that individuals who feel “last place” or tied for last are drawn to rhetoric promising to preserve or enhance white status, as it may help reduce the racialized status threat they perceive.

1qz9158,Cooley_Psych_Colgate,"Thank you for sharing these thoughts — they raise important questions about how inequality is discussed and understood.

Your comment resonates with work we’ve done on the *unintended consequences* of certain kinds of inequality messaging. In a separate paper, we find that among a majority-white sample of social liberals, learning about “white  privilege” can sometimes reduce sympathy for poor white Americans and increase the tendency to blame them for their economic circumstances. That doesn’t mean the concept of structural racism is wrong or unimportant — it very clearly exists — but it does suggest that how inequality is framed can matter for how people respond to others’ hardship.

Our current manuscript doesn’t directly test how DEI-related narratives influence feelings of being “last place,” but we agree this is an important direction for future research. One key issue is that what is true *on average* is not true for *every individual*. For example, the fact that white Americans have higher median wealth than Black and Hispanic Americans does not mean that all white people are economically advantaged, and those nuances can sometimes get lost in public discourse. As a result, some white people may not be able to see the structural inequality through their own disadvantaged lens.

When those distinctions blur, it can deepen resentment and misunderstanding rather than build solidarity — which is why we reason that studying perceptions of relative status is important.

In interrelated work, we also find across multiple representative quota samples of non-Hispanic, white Americans that white Americans, on average, feel as if they are “falling behind” the perceived high status of “most white Americans.” It is an odd effect whereby the perceived relative privilege of one’s racial group (i.e., perceiving ""most white Americans"" to be quite high status) actually seems to seed the feeling that one is not personally measuring up (see also Phillips &amp; Lowery, 2020). We have linked these widespread feelings of falling behind to more negative status-related emotions and, thus, poor health over time among non-Hispanic, white Americans. In contrast, we find that Black Americans, on average, perceive the self as having higher status than “most Black Americans” and these perceptions of “pulling ahead” are not reliably associated with status-related emotions nor mental/physical health.

That said, what our data can speak to is not simply subjective perceptions of poverty. If this were just about feeling poor, we would expect political outcomes to be predicted by where people place themselves alone (the yellow icon). That is not what we find.

Instead, what predicts outcomes like Trump support, Trump voting, and support for DEI bans is the overall *pattern* of responses captured by our latent profile analysis (see the figure in the prompt). In other words, it’s the configuration of how people see their own status in relation to other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. that matters — not subjective (or objective) poverty by itself, and not a single leading item.

Importantly, the measure in reference does not ask participants to attribute their economic situation to other racial groups, nor are they required to endorse any explicitly racial explanation for their circumstances. Likewise, if participants wanted to indicate that they see no differences in status among racial groups, they could place all of the icons in the same location.

One additional point that speaks directly to your concern: the response pattern most predictive of Trump voting, Trump support, and DEI ban support is the “last place–tied” profile. Notably, people in this profile rate their own subjective poverty the **highest** as compared to the other three common patterns of responding (see figure in the prompt). Despite that, neither subjective poverty nor objective indicators of economic hardship emerge as the primary drivers of these political outcomes in our analyses. What matters is how people perceive their relative status — particularly whether they feel they are personally falling behind both their own racial group AND other racial/ethnic groups.

We should also note that we do not measure racism at all in this paper, at least in the ways social psychologists typically operationalize it (e.g., implicit bias measures or direct evaluations of warmth or hostility toward racial groups).

So to your broader point: yes, people can absolutely be upset about economic conditions without being racist. What this paper shows is that when dissatisfaction is framed in terms of relative racial status, that specific perception is strongly linked to political attitudes and behavior. That distinction is what we’re trying to isolate.

1qz9158,Spanktank35,Is it possible that primary racialized status threat is itself driven by another (uncontrolled) factor that is in turn is more directly predictive of voting behaviour?,2026-02-09 21:32:23,reddit
1qz9158,Cooley_Psych_Colgate,"This is certainly possible, and it’s an important limitation of correlational work. Our data do not allow us to definitively establish causal direction, and it’s possible that unmeasured factors contribute both to racialized status perceptions and to voting behavior.

That said, we do account for a range of relevant covariates (e.g., demographics, ideology, economic indicators), and the association between perceived “last place” status and political outcomes remains robust when those factors are included. This suggests that racialized status threat is not simply a proxy for these variables, even if it is not the ultimate causal origin.

Ultimately, identifying upstream causes of these perceptions would require different designs—such as experimental manipulations of status framing or longer-term longitudinal studies than the timeframe we examine here. We are cautious about experimental manipulations because it may be difficult to shift these perceptions in a single intervention; people’s sense of their position in the racial economic hierarchy is likely multiply-determined and reinforced by day-to-day experiences (e.g., confirmation biases).

That said, we are also currently pursuing mixed-methods work, including interviews with individuals in the “last place” profile, to better understand where these perceptions come from.",2026-02-09 22:05:16,reddit

1qz9158,read_ing,"Let me preface this by saying while I have a deep understanding of data and machine learning, I also have just as shallow understanding of psychology, brain sciences and social sciences. So, no intention of masquerading as a domain expert but would love to learn from folks who are such as yourselves.

With that said, having given it some thought in the past - I think a major root cause is that one party is focused on gutting rural infrastructure, schools, health, etc, to give tax cuts to their rich donors causing disproportionate socioeconomic stress to their constituents suppressing critical thinking skills development and leading to short term survival prioritization instead of long term judicious planning ability. This has now been further exacerbated by Citizen’s United which near merges capitalism with politics. I have a name for it - capilitics.

1qz8sf4,Peninj,"Good. 


DEI has been harmful to our politics. The truth about it is, the only reason that corporate America and the democrats embraced it was because they understood that they couldn't continue to sell the myth that success in America was purely meritocratic if when people looked up and saw the same looking people (white men) at the upper levels of success and power despite us clearly living in a multiracial, multiethnic society. The issue is that people born into certain situations are disadvantaged because they do not have the same access to essential resources that the rich and powerful are born into. So, rather than addressing the systemic failure, the political class and corporate elites devised DEI. Theres no laws for DEI, it was just a series of openly stated missions aimed at correcting the perception of the system not being meritocratic.  But that is just it, aimed at correcting the perception and nothing more. Because DEI doesn't really cost anything, its just a system of plucking a few 'exemplar' minorities and putting them into highly visible positions in companies and politics. It doesnt address making sure that no matter who your parents are that you will get a fair chance at success in this country, which is what is really needed. 


Republicans LOVE DEI. Because they get to rail against it. They get to say that the democrats dont care about white people and that causes rage among their base. The democrats love it too. Because both parties fight over DEI, staking out positions on either side trying to persuade their voters that they are the righteous ones fighting the good fight against an unfair system. The perfect windmill to tilt at because no matter what side gets the upper hand, its empty. 


Lets forget DEI and strive for universality. Lets make sure every single American has access to the resources necessary to live full and successful lives. Lets stop elevating a few success stories and pretending that we've solved the problem.",2026-02-08 14:07:09,reddit
1qz8sf4,TheVintageJane,"The way to make sure that everyone has the resources to live a successful and fulfilling life, often mean putting in extra work to ensure that people for whom this society wasn’t specifically constructed get access to those opportunities. Sometimes that means investing in recruiting opportunities that target specific historically marginalized groups, or ensuring that HR polices don’t promote racism (e.g. policies against Black+ hairstyles or using AI interviewing technology that perceives white, male, neurotypical mannerisms as more professional) or providing mentorship opportunities for veterans (one of the biggest groups to benefit from DEI).

While we should always be critical of those efforts and make sure they don’t become quotas or other problematic policies, in actuality these policies help ensure the best talent is recruited and retained regardless of group membership. Whether we call that affirmative action, DEI or whatever the next iteration will be, there will always be some people who are mad that they feel they aren’t getting their fair share and would rather blame Black folks or women (and god forbid, Black women) for stealing something than look at the dragons hoarding our economic prosperity in off shore bank accounts.",2026-02-08 15:08:13,reddit

I agree. Diversity has tremendous value onto itself. And I further agree that there is entrenched racism in the system. But to actually address the widespread problems as opposed to just making it look like it’s being addressed, requires substantial systematic overhaul where in basic needs are met for all people. And everyone is given the tools to reach the highest echelons of success and power.

Some people get hung up on the fact that public employees are often unionized and make better wages, and unwisely conflate this with ""waste"". Paying people a living wage throughout their career promotes retention and higher levels of expertise, curtailing huge training expenses and inevitable costs of an undertrained workforce. More importantly, unlike private businesses which must prioritize profit, public entities run at cost. Even if a private business could match the lower consumer prices of their public counterparts, they'd be doing so by pickpocketing their own employees, using lower quality materials, using unethical practices, etc. That profit margin has to come from somewhere — and it's generally not coming from ""innovation"".",2026-02-08 16:06:54,reddit

That's because social services (government run services) and privatization (privately run services) are conceptually opposed.

Privately run services have a monetary objective. Profit, if it exists, goes into the owners' pockets. Self-enrichment is the ultimate goal.

Government run services, on the other hand, have an assistance objective. Profit, if it exists, goes into improving the service. Providing a better service, that assists the people better, is the ultimate goal.

If we looked at every single function and service in society in this way, as a business in a vacuum, on average we'd find that about half of them are ""unprofitable"" because the net cash flow of the entire world occurs in a closed system, because profits on one hand incur a cost on the other hand.

1qz7pb6,bloomberg,"*The convergence of two historically distinct agencies is redefining how immigration law is enforced inside the US.*  
  
*Fola Akinnibi for Bloomberg News*  
  
When Mark Pettibone was swept off a Portland street into an unmarked minivan by a group of people in camouflage and tactical gear during the George Floyd protests in 2020, he had no idea who they were or where he would be taken. In the vehicle, he said they pinned him down and pulled his beanie over his eyes so he couldn’t see where they were going.  
  
Pettibone was taken to a federal facility, arrested, processed, put in a cell and then released without paperwork, charges or a sense of why he’d been arrested, he alleged in a lawsuit. It was only later that he’d learn he had been detained by Customs and Border Protection officers.  
  
The incident was an early sign of the Trump administration’s willingness to deploy these immigration officers far from the nation’s land borders, and its burgeoning comfort with military-style operations in US cities. In Trump’s second term, tactics used by federal immigration officers have evolved to include roving patrols, using force for crowd control, warrantless arrests, shootings and a raid on an apartment complex using a Black Hawk helicopter — all of which have marked ongoing enforcement activity in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans and beyond.  
  
The federal agents’ aggressive behavior has jarred both local and global observers, spurring mass protest. Federal immigration agents have not historically patrolled the streets of these cities.  
  
But many of these practices are not new in US immigration enforcement; they’ve migrated from border areas to the middle of America’s densest neighborhoods. They’re being circulated in viral videos for the world to see, instead of being relegated to deserts and dead-of-night operations. Agents also appear more emboldened than ever before, more frequently using tactics like deploying tear gas and other non-lethal weapons.

I admit I was sidelined until recent years because it's hard to demonize a nation that only was not built upon the trauma of generations of victimized people, and done so horrifically in recent memory, but also surrounded by other nations that harbor what our nation considers terrorist groups, it's difficult to reverse the views of the majority. Obviously racism plays into that too, not for me personally but it plays its part in the national consensus.  Even as long running and blatant as it's been, for me it wasn't until this last 6 months that I could really separate the leaders of said nation from what their people have gone thru and seen them as the antithesis of what their very nation was built upon.  As for America, the beacon and savior of democracy in recent memory (despite years of evidence speaking differently) it's also objectively hard to discuss how far the reality has fallen from what we were taught growing up and viewed ourselves for our whole lives. I wonder if Rome thought they were still giants until they fell, in either empire. Even with the president who doesn't represent what anyone even in MAGA would want their children would aspire to, the belief that the principles of America if at least for it's own people still hold is a hard thread to let go of. I still hold hope that their can be a course correction when this mess is done, but we've never undergone such an assault on the executive branch. For some generations it will be all they know of for the presidency.  I hope that this is an outlier but there's reason to believe that once something is broken it may never go back.

1qz75pd,zsreport,"A bit from the commentary:

&gt; After decades of documenting state terror, I know how it starts. Governments begin to use words like security, order, deterrence. Every excuse for Benjamin Netanyahu’s conduct in Gaza is framed as “security”. ICE agents are trained in a language of order in which violence becomes procedure.
&gt; 
&gt; What happens when democratic states adopt the methods of the regimes they once condemned? Terror is not only masked men and arbitrary detention. It also operates through fear. Policies are designed to make people more compliant, more submissive. As the historian Timothy Snyder warned in his 2017 book, On Tyranny, this is how societies slide into danger: people obey in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; In Donald Trump’s US, I have watched CEOs, academics, journalists and government officials allow fear to override decency and moral authority. I have seen this pattern before. It begins with claims that certain people are dangerous. That ordinary legal safeguards should not apply to them. It ends with a society diminished – more compliant, more cynical, more brutal. State terror is rarely announced. In my experience, it becomes normalised. It seeps quietly into the machinery of government.

1qz75pd,ReadIcculus555,"The United States government did not respond to 9/11 by directly going after those responsible. Instead they used anti-Arab sentiment to drum up support to invade Iraq, an entirely unrelated nation.

The murders, rapes, and kidnappings by Hamas, who lives right next door to Israel and not an ocean away, gives Israel not only the right but the responsibility to their own people to make sure Hamas is never ever able to do that sort of thing ever again, ever. As well as the decades of Israelis living under constant fear of Hamas rockets raining down on their heads. Israel also had a responsibility to use the only tool understood by Hamas - military pressure - to force them to release all hostages, which is exactly what happened.

If Hamas then retreated to their tunnel network under civilian infrastructure that is longer than the entire NY subway system, that connects with all manners of civilian infrastructure buildings where they hold command centers, rocket silos/weapon storage sites, rocket launch sites, training sites, etc etc, then each and every one of those buildings attached to or on top of those tunnels become not only valid legal military targets, but also targets that Israel is under an obligation to its civilians to strike and eliminate. If a mosque is storing rockets, it legally stops being a mosque and becomes a rocket storage site with a side hustle in prayer. If civilians die in any such strikes, international law says that the fault rests on the government that is using civilian infrastructure for military purposes, which itself is a war crime.

1qz4grr,Individual-Guest-123,"Many years ago I owned a place downhill of a blueberry barren. that was commercially managed. Helicopters would come spray. My well was not far from the bottom of the barren, so I paid big bucks for a pesticide screen. 

The test came back positive for Velpar (Hexaninone) an herbicide. I contacted the EPA, the board of pesticides, etc. They were actually worried about blowback because Montsanto had just developed round up ready corn.

Oh and apparently now it is known that it can cause Hodgkins disease, and a pesticide screen through the state lab coast a minor fortune. 

It did cause a stir and they tested a bunch of school wells that were near fields and found it in other groundwater too. (It is highly water soluble)

I had also heard That the big blueberry buyer, Wymans, had directed their producers not to blanket spray, but spot apply, which is interesting because that is where the torts are at.

Herbicides create the groundwater risk, since they need to be water soluble to be taken up by the target. Insecticides are bad because they are sticky so they stick to the fruit to kill insects that want to lay eggs on them, which is why you are supposed to wash fruit. Not sure exactly how, I have heard soap residue can be bad and I am unclear if just water removes it. Not likely, because growers would want it to stay and not be washed off in a rainstorm.

1qz4grr,Bbrhuft,"Just to point out that dicamba isn't banned in any other countries, except Vietnam. 

Dicamba is used in conjunction with GMO crops, modified to be immune to its effects. Thus, farmers can spray dicamba on their crops during growing season, killing weeds while sparing dicamba resistant crops. So, in counties where GMO crops are banned, it's not used. This gives an impression it's banned. 

However, there's a catch. It's such an effective herbicide that it can drift on the wind and damage neighbouring crops and bordering plants, negativity affecting biodiversity. So in most countries where it's used, it's application is strictly regulated. Rules dictate *how it's used, when it's used and on what it's used*. These regulations aim to minimise the risk of spray drift.

US is an exception, GMO crops are big business and regulations on its spraying are lax so there's cases of farmers suing neighbouring farmers because dicamba drifted on the wind and damaged thier crops. It also it damages plants bordering fields, destroying plants used by pollinators and other insects and animals dependent upon wild plants. 

In the EU and several other countries, dicamba effectively banned, not because the chemical itself is banned, but there's simply no use for it because they banned GMO crops.

I think this is important to point out, as when we hear a chemical is banned, it's usually due to its intrisnic risk to humans and nature. However, dicamba has a low toxicity to humans and other animals, including insects, and it's biodegradable. It also doesn't accumulate in aquifers or rivers, or bioaccumulate. That said, there's a few studies that found an association (association doesn't mean causation) with farmers using dicamba and non-hodgkinson lymphoma, it's still classified as ""not likely to be carcinogenic to humans"".",2026-02-08 14:33:40,reddit
1qz4grr,TemperanceOG,"Key Regulatory Aspects of Dicamba:
2026 Reinstatement: Following a 2024 court-ordered ban on certain formulations, the EPA reinstated, with strict, strengthened restrictions, the use of low-volatility dicamba products for the 2026 growing season across 34 states.
Specific Approved Products: Only specific, low-volatility formulations (e.g., Engenia, XtendiMax, Tavium) are approved for over-the-top use on dicamba-tolerant (DT) cotton and soybeans.
Stringent Requirements: Use requires mandatory, specialized training, strict tank-mix restrictions, drift reduction technology, and designated downwind buffers to protect non-target areas and endangered species.
Environmental Concerns: The primary concern with dicamba is its ability to volatilize (turn into gas) and drift, causing damage to nearby, non-tolerant plants, trees, and gardens.

Drift/volatility can never be prevented it can only be reduced, and farmers dont follow label language to help reduce it. In general its poor application by applicators thats the problem.

1qz4grr,codeemalia,"&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday reapproved the weed killer dicamba for use on genetically modified soybeans and cotton, a pesticide that has raised widespread concern over its tendency to drift and destroy nearby crops.

&gt;The agency said dicamba was critical for farmers who would otherwise have their crops threatened by fast growing weeds. To ensure the pesticide is used safely, the agency said it imposed strong protections and limits on its use.

&gt;Dicamba is a common weed killer that can be sprayed on top of genetically engineered crops. It kills the weeds but doesn’t hurt the crops. It has been in use for decades, but it has become more widespread on farms in recent years.

&gt;Advocates sharply criticized the agency, saying they are moving forward after courts blocked similar efforts in 2020 and 2024. Allowing its use on these two common crops will drastically expand how much is applied and increase harm, advocates say.

&gt;The agency said concerns about dicamba drifting to places where it was not intended are real and must be managed. It set limits on how much can be applied per acre, how much can be applied on hot days and established buffer zones to prevent harm to nearby crops. If followed, the chemical can be used without threatening humans or the environment, according to EPA.

&gt;The American Soybean Association applauded the decision, saying clear rules would help farmers prepare for the next growing season and control destructive weeds.

&gt;Environmental groups said dicamba drift has damaged immense acreage, devastating vegetable farms, trees and other critical plants.

&gt;“When push comes to shove, this administration is willing to bend over backward to appease the pesticide industry, regardless of the consequences to public health or the environment,” said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity.

&gt;Environmentalists said the EPA’s use restrictions are insufficient, allowing application for too much of the time and for too many days of the year. The buffer the agency uses to prevent harm to nearby plants has already proved ineffective, they said.

&gt;Researchers have been working to better understand its health risks. A 2020 study in the International Journal of Epidemiology found that dicamba exposure was linked to an increased risk for some cancers, including liver cancer and a type of leukemia affecting the blood and bone marrow.

Vote against him for what? The director of Health and Human services isn't an elected position, and even as a confirmed position that doesn't get voted on in the house.

1qz34ah,ThunderChild247,"That’s a definite possibility as well. But there’s also two other possibilities:

1) Epstein knew where all the blackmail evidence was and took it to his grave leaving Maxwell high and dry.

2) They both knew where the evidence is so Maxwell’s staying alive through a mix of carrot and stick (keep me alive and I tell the world you didn’t rape kids, and if I die the world gets proof that you did).

I fully expect that the DOJ’s been tasked with finding Epstein’s blackmail material and at that point if they confirm they’ve 1) found it all or 2) it doesn’t exist, Maxwell’s only chance of surviving is to make herself so useful by “exonerating” the particular people in power. 

Either way she’s a duplicitous witch who schemed and manipulated her way through life, gaining and retaining a position at the right hand of a monster by facilitating and joining in with horrific abuse.

1qz34ah,IHAVEBIGLUNGS,"I mean if you look into it, it seems pretty clear there wasn’t anyone powerful pulling the strings at that point. It seems like Epstein was incredibly charismatic and had a unique ability to get high net worth people to trust him. He wasn’t hired as a trading executive, he manipulated his way into a low levels options trading position. He then experienced a meteoric rise because they basically put him in the wealth management dept handling clients directly, where it seems likely his chief talent was making sure the clients kept their money there whether the line went up or down. That’s a more valuable skill to bear stearns than making the line go up.

When he was fired for regulatory violations, he became second in command at an enormous ponzi scheme that he left a year or so before they were charged. It is likely he made more money there than his partnership at bear stearns. 

From there what secured his position was using the conman charisma that characterized his early career to nab Les Wexner as a client, and the rest is history.

Obviously it’s extremely sketch but I didn’t quite get what the article’s conclusion was. Like could that have just been a typo or is it proof that not only was Epstein murdered but the Prosecutor was in on it?

First time hearing this too (not that it wasn’t news before, I probably just missed it. Or maybe I did see and forgot, idk):

&gt;Epstein’s **former cellmate**, Nicholas Tartaglione, **claimed in a pardon petition filed last summer that Epstein was deliberately left unprotected in federal custody**. Tartaglione, a former police officer convicted of multiple murders, alleged that **prison officials knowingly housed Epstein with an accused mass murderer** despite earlier reports that the disgraced financier had raised concerns about his safety weeks before his death.

That in addition to this new revelation makes it incredibly obvious that he did not just kill himself, that’s for sure.

&gt;Justice Department documents show investigators reviewing jail **surveillance footage flagged an orange-colored figure moving up a staircase toward the locked tier housing Epstein’s cell** at about 10:39 p.m. on Aug. 9, 2019—hours before his body was discovered the next morning. An observation log **described the figure as “possibly an inmate”.**

&gt;CBS reported that independent video analysts said the movement was more consistent with an inmate—or someone wearing an orange prison uniform—than a corrections officer. **Prison employees told CBS that escorting an inmate at that hour would have been highly unusual.**

An actual investigation needs to be done because anybody with half a brain can tell more than the official story of suicide was going down. But it seems like everyone involved is corrupted and in on it. 

Remember when that AI video of Epstein hanging himself momentarily popped up in the epstien files? They were blatantly fabricating false evidence, like WTF why wasn’t that a bigger deal? Why is nobody in a position of power calling this out?",2026-02-08 08:31:18,reddit

As someone who used to post press releases and similar announcements on a company website and to send to our dealer mailing list, this is absolutely something I have missed changing. I also know the people who authored the actual copy would use a prior document as a starting template as well.

That means more takedowns, more demonetization, more “no politics” rules, stricter identity requirements, and stricter filters around high-risk names and topics. This not because the First Amendment changed, but because the cost of hosting speech becomes too high.

So the practical result is less speech, especially speech that criticizes powerful people who can afford lawyers. The First Amendment doesn’t get “repealed,”it gets priced out.

Recently, he’s leaned hard into fear mongering while sounding pretty under-informed about how AI and recommendation algorithms already work and what existing guardrails/laws actually cover. 

And if you unwind the Section 230 angle, the real-world outcome isn’t “safer kids,” it’s “platforms get sued over users’ posts,” which pushes sites to over-moderate, kill comment sections, and/or require real-ID just to reduce risk. This leads to Chinese-style dystopian internet.

Put everything on the parents to decide what their kids can and cannot do. The government has no place in banning kids. The government just needs the regulation giving parents 100% control over their kids accounts. 

You can even take it a step further to punish kids if they find ways around the parental controls and do something criminal.  Like 1 year ban from the internet.  ",2026-02-08 05:52:12,reddit

1qz0ekt,ShippFFXI,"Yes, however these are things that can be taught in the schools under their firewalls.  All of that can be taught within the walls of the school itself without requiring the middle school student to have unfettered internet access at home, which was my point.


The school should be allowing the printing of supplemental online materials for any research paper at the school and allowing the students to take them home.  Or using a thumb drive for easier home access without requiring tons of printing.  Schools will usually have access to subscription based sources for scientific research and whatnot which are going to be far better anyway than anything a student is going to find online without the subscription service. 


Digital textbooks should be available to be downloaded by the parents and then able to be read in offline mode by the kids. 


I'm not seeing a lot of ""kids need the internet"" when they simply don't.  I can understand highschoolers needing it to a degree, but it's much like cellphones.  It's amazing how all of us pre-cellphones grew up without them.  I got my first at 16 when I was able to drive by myself in case of emergencies.  They still are not necessary to many people.  Hell, I have a friend who refuses to get a smartphone and never has owned one.


There is a lot of muddying of the terms ""want"" and ""need"" going on in these discussions, usually.  Cellphones and the internet are convenient and certainly can help make lives easier.  I can quickly find recipes instead of having to dig grandma's cookbook out from the shelf and find what I am looking for.  There is also the problem that the vast majority of people (myself included) are way to reliant on not actually learning and retaining info, because, ""I can just Google that later.""  Until the entire system collapses and it isn't there later.

However, Trump did not create MAGA.  Truly the rise of both was quite synergistic and intertwined.  But it is not the slogan that made the movement.  Instead it is more appropriate to consider Trump the golden calf the group hoisted up to worship.

Trump disappearing will likely cause this specific movement to falter.

But the environment that led this group to chose a icon or idol, remains.

And that environment is very much fueled by the positions, policies and practices of the GOP and the groups behind the GOP like the Heritage foundation.

Trump can be pro-Israel one day, and dog whistle anti-Jewish hatred the next.  Both factions hear the part they want to hear and ignore the rest.

**There are 44 elections in February alone** [according to Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Elections_calendar) that are spanning: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, New Jersey, Louisiana, Texas, Minnesota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Wisconsin, Delaware, Maine, and Pennsylvania.

Change *does not* start at the midterms or presidential elections; those elections only reinforce. Change *starts* at the numerous state, county, judicial, sheriff, mayor, city council, and education board election that happens between *now* and the midterms.

*Every* seat Democrats win at *any* level makes rigging the midterms that much harder for Trump. So *do not wait* until the midterms. Exercise every ounce of your right to vote *before* Trump moves to end them.

*Do not wait for the midterms.*

[Utah governor signs bill adding justices to state Supreme Court as redistricting appeal looms](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/governor-utah-signs-bill-adding-justices-state-supreme-court-redistric-rcna256894)

&gt;Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill Saturday that expands the state Supreme Court from five justices to seven as frustration has mounted among Republican lawmakers over a string of defeats before the tribunal.

&gt;Republican advocates for the change argued that it would help improve the court’s efficiency. But legal experts said it could have the opposite effect and set a dangerous precedent at a time of tension between the branches of government. The state’s judiciary did not ask for more justices on the high court.

&gt;Democrats, who were united in opposition to the bill, called the timing suspicious. Last week the Legislature asked the court to overturn a redistricting ruling that gave Democrats a strong shot at picking up one of Utah’s four Republican-held congressional seats in the fall.

&gt;New justices could be in place when the court decides the fate of the congressional map.

&gt;Because the bill received approval from more than two-thirds of legislators, it took effect immediately after the governor signed it, allowing him to bypass a several-month waiting period to start adding justices.

&gt;In Utah, justices are appointed by the governor and approved by the state Senate. Justices in many other states are elected.

Democrats should expand the Federal Supreme Court.",2026-02-08 04:13:56,reddit

More Dems taking former Trump won districts is always nice to see

Democrats are not perfect by any means, but they are certainly a better choice and I look forward to seeing this trend of Dems wins to continue into November so at least the last part of the Vance presidency won't be quite *so* bad and hopefully 2028 will get us a nice Dem President as a result  ",2026-02-08 06:48:22,reddit

This greatly upset Republicans so they found some bitter former soldiers who were willing to lie about Kerry’s conduct in Vietnam, claiming he didn’t really deserve some of the medals he earned there. 

Of course it was all proven to be false, but only well after the damage had been done.

I'm fully remote and have lived in 5 different states in the last 7 years, so it's not dependent on location.

He was fined in the 70s for discriminating against black tenants, and the rest is history.

Trump IS the conservative zeitgeist, and he always has been. The conservative white supremacist has always deeply hated the black community. The conservative has always idolized wealth, denigrated hard work, and licked the boot.

And when policies go wrong they actually do tend to correct them, though of course, that's not to say they don't just make new mistakes.

But if you look at big problems, for instance grid integration or water transportation, they have big ambitious plans that are rapidly being implemented. Their infrastructure development is extremely ambitious, it realistically dwarfs anything in history. 

And this is because they do have a lot of centralised control, albeit regional power and incentives being very important and sometimes misaligned, and they can just decide to do these things, and there *are* of course consequences, in the same way there were consequences to the industrial revolution in Britain, people do suffer . . but things absolutely do get done, and in the long run quality of life has risen immensely for a huge number of people.

The US is possibly the most fantastically inefficient and dysfunctional advanced economy there is. It imprisons by far the most people per capita, spends the most on healthcare but gets the worst outcomes, spends vast fortunes on law enforcement but somehow has more crime etc.

And a lot of that really is down to poor institutional design, the constitution was very poorly thought out, and escalating corruption without obvious ways of fixing it, again, in large part due to institutional design. It still does have legal processes, rights and so on, though the judiciary is far from independent.

But rights only matter if they can be expressed meaningfully, of course. For all the right wing complaints that Europe has somehow given up freedom of speech because it has hate speech laws, Europeans on most metrics enjoy greater overall liberty and security. Europe at its best is still the best place to actually live, though it is a lot more dysfunctional than it was, and for many of the same reasons, inequality and power concentration being real concerns.",2026-02-08 17:06:08,reddit

1qyvvy8,All_Hail_Hynotoad,"&gt; By The Associated Press

&gt;The Alabama prison system has moved three well-known inmate activists who supported a 2022 prison strike and were featured in an Oscar-nominated documentary about the troubled system to isolated cells with little contact with others, family members and attorneys said.

&gt;Family members of the three men said they fear for their loved ones’ safety and are concerned the moves to solitary confinement are a form of retaliation for outspokenness about problems within the prison system.

&gt; Robert Earl Council, Melvin Ray and Raoul Poole were transferred two weeks ago from their existing prisons to solitary confinement at Kilby Correctional Facility outside Montgomery, Alabama, their lawyers said. The transfers come as some groups have encouraged a new prison labor strike this year.

&gt;”This is straight-up retaliation,” said Julie Sledd, who is close to Poole and spoke to The Associated Press about his situation. “They’ve all three been very involved in standing up for the rights of incarcerated citizens.”

&gt;Council, Ray and Poole were featured in “The Alabama Solution,” a documentary about the state prison system that relied heavily on cell phone footage from inmates. The film has been nominated for an Academy Award in the documentary category.

&gt; Sledd said she has been able to talk to Poole once since the transfer and he told her the men are being held in separate cells on an isolated and closely guarded floor.

&gt;”Since their arrival, the men have been cut off from contact with their families and are being held in isolation with no contact with other prisoners or prison staff except for a small group of guards and supervisors,” lawyers representing the three men said in a statement.

&gt;The attorneys said the prison system did not provide a reason for the move and said the restrictions “far exceed standard administrative segregation protocols.”

&gt;”Given ADOC’s decade-long documented history of excessive force against prisoners and its pattern of retaliation against these specific individuals — including a prior 2021 incident in which four guards nearly killed Robert Council — their attorneys fear for the activists’ safety and well-being,"" the lawyers wrote.

&gt;The Alabama Department of Corrections cited security concerns as the reason the men were moved, but did not elaborate.

&gt;”The transfer of inmates is based on intelligence that they are engaged in activity that is detrimental to the safety and security of the facilities and the public,” prison officials said in an statement emailed by spokeswoman Kelly Betts.

&gt;The statement added that “all inmates are safe, secure, and receiving regular meals and other services as needed,” and that they have had legal visits and phone service.

&gt;Earnestine Council said Wednesday that she has gotten little information about her son and has not been able to speak with him. Ann Brooks, Ray’s mother, said she hasn’t been able to reach her son, although he was able to make one call to his brother.

&gt;”I don’t know what is going to happen or what could happen,” Brooks said.

&gt;The moves come as some have pushed for a new prison labor strike this year similar to one in 2022 that drew national attention. Thousands of Alabama inmate workers went on strike that year, refusing to labor in prison kitchens, laundries and factories to protest conditions in the state lockups.

&gt;Several inmates told The Associated Press that prisons have recently reduced the amount of food and other items they can purchase each week at the prison commissary, a move that could prevent items from being stockpiled ahead of any strike.

&gt;The prison system said in a statement that food service has been contracted out to a new vendor, Aramark, but didn’t elaborate.

&gt;”We’re really concerned because they’ve had retaliation and abuse in response to all of their activism,” said Andrew Jarecki, director of “The Alabama Solution.”

&gt;”It’s particularly ironic that these men who are incredibly brave — and frankly, scholars — and have learned the law and have been leaders and always observe nonviolent means of protest, are always met with violence by authorities.""",2026-02-08 02:55:47,reddit

Almost every adult has a government-issued ID, but many do not have a passport or a birth certificate or a Real ID, which (AFAIK) are the only three forms of ID which comprise proof of citizenship. And for those who do have those forms of ID, many (such as married women) do not have a name on their passport or Real ID which matches their birth certificate name.

So requiring proof of citizenship can disenfranchise many citizens from voting.

It's enough that there are criminal penalties for non-citizen voting to put the fear of a felony conviction into those who are not eligible to vote. This keeps fraudulent voting vanishingly small.",2026-02-08 01:46:19,reddit

- Becky runs the school newspaper and morning announcements.

- Becky announces over the intercom and runs a front page paper that Susie is a liar, and jealous of Becky for not being put on student council or the paper and making up lies about her.

- Most of the students are bombarded with Becky's side of the story since she controls the media and Susie has no major platform to rebuttle the claims

- Any further attempts by Susie only reach a small section of the school and Becky washes her out with more front page ads and intercom announcements about Susie

- Becky feels smug that she drowned out Susie's claims and its all heresay



VS


- Susie lobbies to have a televised Student Council meeting in front of the whole school where Becky is present.

- Susie makes her claim about Becky

- Becky makes her claim about Susie lying and being jealous

- Susie provides proof of Becky's theft 

- Becky is caught on the spot without a way to efficiently disprove the claim and no time to prepare a statement

As in, he used to do exactly what was customary - get a woman alone, by trickery if you have to, have your way and let her think it's her own fault for being stupid. But I think he eventually realized this is not acceptable and it's possible he changed his ways. He's a smart political operator. I recall stories :/

1qytz1s,Guardianpigeon,"Clinton doesn't deserve any sort of charity regarding Epstein. Between his reputation regarding sex and the fact that they had Maxwell at their daughter's wedding post the first conviction, we should assume at minimum that they were extremely negligent people. 

However I think an open hearing is still correct and support him calling for it. I think they'll filibuster, plead the 5th and reveal nothing new regarding Epstein either way, but the public hearing allows us to see it for ourselves instead of letting the GOP control the narrative afterwards. I'd rather see video evidence of Clinton saying stuff that may damn him rather than take the GOP spin machine's word for it.

But never treat this guy as a hero. Even if he has damning evidence that would take down this entire administration, it just means he's had it all along and kept it for self preservation over the children who were harmed and all the people who suffered under Trump. If he really had nothing to do with Epstein then this is all just a farce anyway and his reputation shouldn't change. If he did have involvement and uses it to take down Trump, than he's just a complete bastard who deserves to go to jail with Trump, he just happened to do a decent thing in the 11th hour.

Clinton, without any hesitation, pointed to, and claimed the most ridiculous one of the lot.

When Blair asked him why he had chosen the worst one, Clinton said ""When the folks back home see me in it they'll say ""poor guy they MADE him wear that. When your folks see you in yours - they'll think you chose it"".

Donald [Trump](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-news/) is forcing people to remain loyal to him by ""blackmailing"" them with ""secret Epstein recordings,"" according to an Air Force vet. [Jake Broe](https://x.com/RealJakeBroe), a United States Air Force veteran who served as a Nuclear and Missile Operations Officer, on Saturday used a [video](https://www.rawstory.com/all-video/) from a right-wing activist to make his point against Trump and the DOJ. Conservative political observer James O'Keefe in 2025 utilized an undercover operation to expose Pam Bondi, who admitted to a ""nanny"" that the DOJ was sifting through tens of thousands of inappropriate pictures of little kids.

The post uses the video from O'Keefe to hammer the DOJ's conduct. Broe added, ""Trump's Justice Department is in possession of thousands of videos of children being graped by wealthy and powerful men...Those men WERE being blackmailed by Epstein. But by not releasing their names, these men must now be loyal to Trump to protect their identities,"" he further stated. ""Trump is now using Epstein's secret recordings to blackmail the most powerful people in the world so they remain loyal to him.""",2026-02-08 14:53:38,reddit

His chief of staff - in recent times - had to take him aside to tell him to stop making sexual comments about his daughter. That's his behaviour in front of other people in a professional setting.  I'm fond of reminding people, Stormy Daniels said that one of his main observations was that she reminded him of his daughter. He's called her a piece of ass. The one thing they have in common is ""sex"" as he said on a talk show. There's no reasonable explanation for all of this.

Lastly, there is no legitimate reason to own a teen beauty pageant. Sorry. It may well be normalized and accepted as a thing but if the idea was invented tomorrow it would be torn apart. Nobody can tell me Donald J Trump has any legitimate interest in ""modelling"" or fashion. It's entirely about ""owning"" teenagers.

For me, what takes all of this grotesque stuff up a few notches is the fact that he's fucking vile as a man. He's obese, he looks ridiculous with his makeup, he doesn't work out, he apparently has a small strange dick, he shits himself routinely and apparently he can barely perform according to Stormy. Yet, he thinks he is some kind of Adonis who looks like Elvis, has a huge dick and is ""a very young man"" \[he said this in his 70s\]. Truly mentally ill.

1qytydc,Bbrhuft,"I see [one of the crimes listed on your linked document](https://people.com/epstein-files-rape-allegation-against-trump-11875364), involving Trump stalking and pulling a gun on a Dallas Limo Driver in 1995 (or the limo driver almost pulling a gun on Trump, accounts vary) after taking to Epstein on the phone about abusing a minor, and Maxwell later murdering his daughter weeks after she told him she was abused by Epstein, and a Clinton body guard attempt to frame his girlfriend for the Oklahoma City bombing (and the same body guard helped carry out the Oklahoma City bombing) is from a mentally ill man, Dan Ferree. 

Dan also published a video in which he recounted his convoluted story, he states he submitted the FBI tip and his story indeed matches the gist the FBI tip, though it's now more confusing, likely due to a futher deterioration in his mental health. From latest his ramblings, it's clear to most (but frustratingly, not all) that this fellow has a mental illness. 

Also, there's a thread here on Reddit where his ex and her son (not his son) warn people that he's mentally ill, not be belive what he's saying, and they recount just what an ass he's been to them. Dan is stalking his ex-girlfriend and family, and he killed their cat.

So please understand the FBI tip line, which makes up the bulk of the tips listed on your linked document, is unfiltered raw data, it's not vetted or investigated. However, too much trust is currently placed in it. The accounts submitted need to be treated with caution, they need independent verification. Yet, most people treat them as trustworthy. Some maybe true, but others are from people like Mr Ferree. 

Also, my previous post about Dan Ferree's claims:

----------

This was submitted as a tip to the FBI, EFTA00020517, on the 27^(th) October 2020.

https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020517.pdf

So at least he is consistent. 

However, Dan Ferree's claims jump around, are convoluted and hard to follow. I had to read carefully and listen to him a couple of times. 

Dan says he had Trump in his limo in 1995, collected him at Dallas Forthworth airport, during the limo ride he overheard heard Trump talking to ""Jeffery"" on the phone about sexually assaulting ""some girl"", he was so disgusted at what he heard he almost shot Trump (according to the 2020 tip he gave the FBI). In the video it's switched to Trump staking and threatening him with a gun. 

Then on Christmas Eve 1999 or the day prior, his partner and mother of his son, told him she (or his stepdaughter, in the video, his convoluted ramblings are confusing and change between the FBI tip and video) Met Ghislaine Maxwell in 1997, Maxwell provided her financial support and introduced her to Trump, who raped her along with Jeffrey Epstein. She called the police to report this crime. Dan also alleged that John Doe No.2 (the mysterious second man witnesses claim they saw with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh before the 1995 bombing, who was ultimately never identified. Terry Nichols does not have a brother named John) was ""John W. Nichols"", a security guard for the Clintons, who attempted to frame his partner for the Oklahoma City bombing after Hillary Clinton had a drunken argument with her. Finally on January 10, 2000, he claims Ghislaine Maxwell murdered his daughter to silence her though the coroner ruled it suicide.

So almost shot Trump or Trump nearly shot him. Then the mother of his son (or his stepdaughterin) met Maxwell, was raped by Trump and Epstein, was almost framed (or was that his wife / partner) for the Oklahoma City bombing by a security guard for the Clinton's, who was John Doe No. 2 (the mystery accomplice of bomber Timothy McViegh), then was murdered by Maxwell. 

I think that's it. It's a mess, result likely of mental illness, so it's convoluted and changes between the FBI and video. 

The claims have been dismissed “untrue and sensationalist”. I wonder why?

They know they will lose in the midterms.  This gives the dems a pretty good majority to work with and not need any republicon support.

Leaving gIves a different republicon candidate a better chance of keeping the seat because they are new, not part of the problem,  run as the ""change"" candidate, and still republicon for those fence sitting republican/independent voters who just can't seam to get it up for a democrat.

My guess is these republicons were told to pack it in and not run for the above reasons.  And it keeps the corporate/church doners onboard.  Probably setup with cushy ""consulting"" jobs with lobby firms or defense contractors.

1qytttd,P_a_s_g_i_t_24,"&gt;**Trump’s Tie to Whistleblower Report Tulsi Hid in Safe Busted**

&gt;A new report alleges Tulsi Gabbard was informed of a call between a person associated with foreign intelligence and someone close to Donald Trump. The whistleblower complaint that Trump’s spy chief locked away in a safe implicated someone with close ties to the president of having contact with foreign intelligence. \[...\]

&gt;When National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard was informed, she took a paper copy of the memo to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. The day after that meeting, she instructed the NSA to send the highly classified details to her office instead of publishing them, according to the whistleblower’s attorney Andrew P. Bakaj.

&gt;Gabbard was accused of hiding the complaint made against her in a safe. Bakaj, who was briefed on the sensitive phone call, told The Guardian that the whistleblower first contacted the office of the intelligence community inspector general about the burying of the highly classified materials on April 17, 2025. The whistleblower then filed a formal complaint on May 21, 2025. That complaint did not become known to Congress until November. A leaked memo revealed that the complaint accused Gabbard of refusing to share a “highly classified intelligence report” for “political purposes.” \[...\]

&gt;Gabbard claimed in a nearly 600-word X post on Saturday that Johnson did not inform her that the whistleblower wanted to take the complaint to Congress. While she knew about the complaint and confirmed that it was kept in a safe, she denied that she “hid” the information and first saw the complaint two weeks ago. \[...\]

&gt;While Gabbard said she sent guidance to the inspector general, Bakaj, the whistleblower’s attorney, sent a letter to Gabbard on Tuesday stating that his client had not received such direction. \[...\]",2026-02-08 00:10:38,reddit

Eventually, the disclosure continued, the IT department launched a formal review of what it deemed a serious, ongoing security breach or potentially illegal removal of personally identifiable information. The whistleblower believes that the suspicious activity warrants further investigation by agencies with more resources, like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or the FBI.""

  
Further down:

""Notwithstanding the NLRB's denial, the whistleblower's disclosure to Congress and other federal overseers includes forensic data and records of conversations with colleagues that provide evidence of DOGE's access and activities. Meanwhile, NPR's extensive reporting makes clear that DOGE's access to data is a widespread concern. Across the government, 11 sources directly familiar with internal operations in federal agencies and in Congress told NPR that they share Berulis' concerns, and some have seen other evidence that DOGE is exfiltrating sensitive data for unknown reasons.""

1qytttd,KittyGrewAMoustache,"Politicians should be banned from social media, it brainwashed them the same way as everyone else. I’m so baffled by western democracies’ pathetic and nothing defence against psychological warfare waged online against their citizens. They’ve just left us wide open for hostile countries to turn our most mentally vulnerable and gullible citizens against us and their own nations. It’s sick. Then politicians just go doom scrolling as well and end up totally infected with nonsense too. And that’s on the left too although not evil as far as I’ve seen, it’s more ‘focus on this irrelevant thing.’ But the right my god it’s like they’ve ransacked their souls. I know people will say oh they’ve always been this way Trump just let it out but I disagree. Some, yeah, but also some previously decent people have had their souls and ethics ripped out of them by social media shit, to the point they literally thing evil is good and vice versa. It’s unbelievable to see. Like government agents murdering unarmed unthreatening citizens is good or at least ok, wanting to respect people by referring to them how they like to be referred to is evil. And it’s so obvious and they cannot see it. Just gone, no one left in there, brains fried by the constant addictive stimulation of fear and hatred.

I know it’s not just foreign countries who’ve done it but there should’ve been protections. It’s a crime against humanity, the way they’ve stripped people of their humanity and turned them into gurning Trump loving monsters. I have faith many can heal if they can get away from the propaganda for long enough for their brains to calm and rewire a bit but god it’s such a crime what has happened. Sometimes it makes me wonder if the anti christ stuff in the bible is true, though I’m not religious, just because of how utterly spooky and supernatural it is.

I guess that will be a well-attended ""march""?

Also, while I never advocate violence, instead of painting something like ""I'm an oppressed billionaire"" on your T-Shirts, maybe just paint a target?

Now that I think about things further, maybe a target is safer than ""I'm an oppressed billionaire"" on the T-shirt?

When I talk about people fighting and standing up, I'm not talking about civil war.  There are other steps to fighting.  For one example, replicating the riots of the 60s that got civil rights passed, or replicating the riots of the early 1900s that got various labor and women's rights laws passed.  For another example, active disruption of MAGA-aligned businesses and predatory industries to shut down their ability to operate at all.  Next, organized efforts to seize empty housing held by capital interests and use them for the needs of the people instead of the greeds of the elites.  And then there's the classic general strike to hold the entire economy hostage and tank the whole damn stock market as a means of showing the oligarchs that we mean business over here.

However I feel like the other commenters here are misunderstanding the ruling. The article says:

&gt; Under the terms of the policy, such immigrants are to be detained ""for the duration of their removal proceedings"" unless granted parole

My understanding of what's being ""changed"" by the 5th circuit here, is the removal of the ""unless granted parole"" part.

Those detained are still only detained ""for the duration of their removal proceedings""... so this does not, within the text of the ruling (or the policy) itself at least, claim that it's somehow now ok to just detain people indefinitely for no reason... which is not a thing that exists within US law.

Whether or not this administration might actually attempt to keep detainees for unreasonable amounts of time is a separate issue, but at least in the context of this ruling, I don't see where it creates any kind of ""concentration camp"" like those are saying.

Instead of people only being detained if they’re intercepted at the border, which is how it used to be handled, they’re now saying anyone *already existing in the US* with a pending asylum case should be remanded to detention until their hearing.

The asylum courts are notoriously backlogged (and I think Trump also just fired a bunch of immigration judges in California), and people often wait years for their hearing to come up. So they’re now saying all those people — which is around 2 million according to the dissenting judge — should be locked up.

1qyrtv9,Choice-of-SteinsGate,"**THE MASHED POTATO INCIDENT**

Donald Trump doesn't like when this story is told.

According to Mary Trump, this is a legendary Trump family story that she describes as an important moment when the president received a scarring taste of humiliation while at the same time discovering his appetite for humiliating others.

It happened when Donald was seven (keep this in mind). Donald had been tormenting his brother Robert at dinner, as he apparently did often. He refused to listen to his mother's pleas to stop. 

Desperate to bring the fighting to an end, a14-year-old Freddy, who is Mary’s father and Donald's older brother, took matters into his own hands and dumped a bowl of mashed potatoes on Donald's head. Everyone in the room, except Donald, burst into laughter.

&gt; ""It was the first time Donald had been humiliated by someone he even then believed to be beneath him. He hadn't understood that humiliation was a weapon that could be wielded by only one person in a fight"", Mary Trump wrote.

&gt; ""From then on, he would never allow himself to feel that feeling again. From them on, he would wield the weapon, never be at the sharp end of it"", he never forgot the incident, Mary said.

Donald Trump would hold a deep-seated grudge against his brother from then on, and would continue to be a relentless asshole towards him for the rest of his life.

When his older sister Maryanne brought up the mashed potato incident at a gathering at the White House in 2017, the president *""listened with his arms tightly crossed and a scowl on his face""... ""He clearly still felt the sting of that long-ago humiliation"".*

There’s one particular quote from Trump that really brings it all together.

Around the time when Trump first received the Republican frontrunner nom, he was interviewed by a famous biographer, and during a rare moment of self reflection, Trump admitted to this biographer:

&gt; ""When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same. The temperament is not that different"".

Coincidentally, first graders are usually around the age of ***seven years old.***

With such a candid remark, Trump may have revealed that the mashed potato incident is a source of trauma for him and perhaps even the beginning of a life long pattern of behavior. 

That same reporter also managed to get some insight into Donald's behavior from his ex wives:

&gt; ""The little boy that still wants attention,"" explained Marla Maples, Trump's second wife. 

She wasn't the only one who thought so.

&gt; ""He wants to be noticed,"" said Ivana Trump, wife No. 1, who recalled sending Trump into a fit of rage by skiing past him on a hill in Aspen, Colorado. Mr. Trump stopped, took off his skis and walked off the trail

&gt; ""He could not take it, that I could do something better than he did,"" she recalled

Trump has the mental and emotional intelligence of a child. He cannot cope with feelings of humiliation, failure, embarrassment, or defeat; these are his greatest fears.  

He is a petty, vindictive, malignant narcissist who seeks out constant attention, approval and applause from those willing to give it, sincerely or not. This helps him internalize these fears and validate the delusions he has about himself.

To Trump, life is a zero sum game—no matter the circumstances. Which is why he is so obsessed with ""winning, winning, winning.""

In his mind, Trump is *always* the winner, even in the face of irrefutable loss. His ego cannot handle any other story. His deranged and compulsive need to be the winner and the constant center of attention is a response to his own deep seated insecurities and fears of being humiliated or defeated. A pathology that was no doubt reinforced by his role model, Roy Cohn, who taught him to always claim victory, no matter the outcome.

This is why he so often uses pretentious and grandiose language to describe himself. Why he is always ""the best"" or the most successful [blank] in history.

It's why he is so obsessed with his ratings, his image and reputation. Why even when confronted with facts and data that expose his waning popularity, he has no other choice but to instinctively deny it.

It's why he cries ""fake news* when encountering any criticism. Why he lashes out like a child bully when a reporter asks a legitimate question that tries to hold him accountable or highlight one of his many inconsistencies.

Perhaps more importantly, it's why every election or competition that he's ever lost was conveniently ""rigged"" against him. It's why he never concedes defeat, and his only recourse is to accuse his opponents of ""cheating."" 

It's why he is incapable of accepting responsibility for his own failures or mistakes. Why every investigation is a ""witch hunt."" Why every journalist that does not shower him with praise is ""nasty,"" ""cruel,"" and ""bad at their job.""

It's why he mocks, belittles and taunts his political opponents, and why he resorts to slander, insults or threats towards others who won't cater to his delicate sensibilities, who won't pledge their undying fealty to him, or compromise their integrity for the sake of his pride and political aspirations.

It's why every judge or person in a position of authority who presents an obstacle to Trump's unconstitutional agenda is an ""activist"" or ""radical leftist"" who must be removed from power.

It's why he is weaponizing the justice department and every power of the federal government to seek retribution against all those who previously wronged him.

It's also why he threatens the careers of talk show hosts who tell jokes at his expense.

Let's also not forget that Trump is a notorious ""cheater"" himself. He is a habitual adulterer, a corrupt conman, a tax fraud, a financial pariah, a grifter, a pathological liar and demagogue who preaches faux-populist rhetoric despite being a kleptocratic thief who picks the American people's pockets while he shamelessly monetizes his presidency to the tune of billions.

He lies about his wealth, he lies about his accomplishments, he lies about his opponents, he lies about his crimes, he lies about his intentions, he lies about his popularity, he lies about himself, he lies about everything, and of course, he lies about elections.

While Donald Trump was accusing his opponents of ""rigging"" the 2020 election, he was scheming to overturn the results of that same free and fair election; which subsequently led to the events of January 6th.

Trump even lies about his golf game.

It's no secret that Donald Trump cheats at golf. He's been caught many times, even by professional athletes.

He brags about fabricated and inflated numbers of tournament wins. He lies about his scores, he sabotages his opponents and he's been accused of defrauding the sport entirely.

Donald Trump must protect his fragile ego by surrounding himself with flatterers and loyalists, by constructing a reality or a safe space where he is free from humiliation, shame, embarrassment, failure... Mashed potatoes.

His pathology is rooted in a lifetime of lies, enablement, narcissistic delusions, unanswerable fraud, and compulsive cheating—all behaviors that stem from deep, lingering fears. To Trump, losing an election or being humiliated by his opponents and critics amounts to a vivid and chilling reliving of ""The Mashed Potato Incident"".

Jamelle continues:

&gt;For years, a cottage industry of political observers has contorted itself to obscure and occlude the obvious. That regardless of what others see in him, Trump’s entire political career — from his embrace of birtherism to his hatred of birthright citizenship — cannot be understood outside the context of his bitter, deep-seated racism.  
  
&gt;Trump is not profound. He has been the same person this whole time. The question is why so many others have refused to see what he has never bothered to hide.

""However, in an earlier post from Friday afternoon, and pinned to the top of her X feed, Loomer wrote that ""DONALD TRUMP DID NOTHING WRONG!"" and posted the original Xerias meme video, and not the video posted to Trump's account, with the claim that ""the fake news media and RINOs like \[Tim Scott\] are lying.

1qyr2eg,FollowingOver1965,"No. They they presented at a port of entry in Texas using the CBP One app to request asylum and passed the initial screening process for credible fear (almost all initial screenings are approved), but have not had their full hearing. They are from Ecuador, which is a pretty safe country provided you are not involved in the drug trade. They have almost no chance of winning at the full hearing in front of the immigration judge. You can't exactly tell the immigration judge that you have a credible fear of persecution back home in Ecuador because you were a drug dealer--you will get deported for that.

They should have moved forward with the hearing immediately. The Board of Immigration Appeals has a backlog of 12-18 months. Under current rules they would almost certainly remain in the US during their appeal and for the subsequent appeal of the BIA decision. Practically speaking, they likely would remained in the US for 5 years, during which time they could seek to adjust their immigration status. Under the new rule they will probably be deported back to Ecuador within a month after losing at the hearing in front of the immigration judge. 

Ecuador is a beautiful country with perfect weather all year long. I am planning to move there within the next 12-18 months. Honestly, I can't imagine why anyone would move from Ecuador to the frozen hell hole of Minnesota. ",2026-02-08 00:13:59,reddit

People were begging the Biden/Harris administration to change course on Israel because we knew that unconditional support for Israel was deeply unpopular among Democratic voters (polls said so at the time) but according to people like you, they caused the problem by pointing it out, and nobody else would have noticed if they hadn't raised a stink about it. 


It's pure Emperor's New Clothes mindset - the Democratic Party can't possibly be to blame for engaging in obvious political malpractice, no! It's the people who pointed out the malpractice who somehow spoke it into existence. We made the Emperor prance around naked by telling him to put some clothes on - it's not his advisors' fault for telling him how fantastic his new outfit was, and it certainly can't be his fault for walking around with his cock flopping out.

Good. He's a terrible candidate. He's unelectable. He's a caricature of out of touch, sleazy politicians. And when he isn't filming himself gleefully tearing down homeless encampements he's bringing all the most odious right-wing figures on his podcast to agree with everything they say.


Maybe, just maybe, people are criticising Newsom so vociferously because we don't want to lose another election?


Maybe, just maybe, we NEED to have these internal confrontations? 


Maybe, just maybe, it is a proven failure of a strategy to settle on one candidate (who isn't even a frontrunner in some polls) 3 years out from an election and demand that everyone shut up and fall in line because ""unity""?

There's probably a long-lost tablet on which a trader pulled the same scam on the Mitannian kings.


Even more noteworthy for our time: a few generations later, the EIC took over Bengal. They dismantled its entire manufacturing industry and sent it back to Britain, where weaving became a new industry and laid the foundation for the Industrial Revolution. Until then, Britain had produced huge amounts of wool but always relied on the Low Countries for refining its raw wool. Britain became a manufacturing powerhouse, whereas before it had been much better at producing raw goods, most of which had slumped in value since the advent of the Early Modern. Bengal went from the richest province in one of the richest countries on the globe to a poverty- and famine-stricken extraction economy working for the EIC. Worse, Bengali weaving practices had especially enriched small family businesses and women in particular, so the EIC also collapsed a thriving lower- and middle-class economy.

1qyqufd,5510,"This is a somewhat slanted view of american college sports.     
         
For one thing, when you keep in mind that American universities are (as I understand) often significantly more expensive than European ones, getting a full scholarship (tuition, food, and housing) was actually a decent amount of ""pay"" for many of the athletes.  It was only the star athletes at major schools in the most popular sports who arguably should have been paid significantly more than the value of a scholarship.  But when you look across all of the college athletes receiving scholarships, for a pretty huge number of them, the scholarship is more than fair.      
              
&gt;So they were not really getting proper education,      
             
Many of them do get proper education.  There are huge numbers of college athletes who got a scholarship, played a sport in college, got their degree, and then got a good job after graduating.       
               
&gt;or career prospects     
       
Many of them get career prospects from their degree / academics.  Others (For very popular sports at major schools) also get career prospects from athletics (and go on to compete professionally).      
       
Do some of them attend school, not take their classes seriously (or lacked the proper academic aptitude to succeed in class), and then when they finish playing, they don't end up with much of a career?  Yes.  But so do many non-athletes... lots of people go to college and it doesn't really work out.     
           
-     
       
It's worth noting that just in the last few years, athletes have been able to start earning significant amounts of money playing college sports (mostly in the major school and more popular sports).  By all accounts though it's a bit of a messy shitshow (like even people in favor of the athletes being paid often say the current rules are a total mess).",2026-02-08 03:30:22,reddit

First, building the stadium and bringing the team(s) in generates income, sales and property tax revenue from all the jobs. Not just the players but all the support staff and third party businesses in the stadium. 

Second, without a subsidy they would obviously need to raise ticket prices. This would have a negative effect on attendance and by extension tax revenue.

Third, by appearing to be a tax friendly city/municipality/state they can encourage more people to setup shop having a net benefit on revenues.

These are important because unlike the Federal Government lesser governments (city/state/county) do not have access to a printing press.

1qyqufd,Legionnaire11,"I agree with you. Every time I see these studies they fail to account for all of the residual impact. But anecdotally, we have a fantastic case study for this in 2004-2005 when the NHL had a full season lockout. I lived in Nashville at the time, so there was no NBA team either to cloud the picture. The Predators didn't play for a full season, which was really only 44 dates (3 preseason and 41 regular season) and what happened was all of the restaurants and hotels downtown saw massive declines in revenue that year. A few restaurants actually went out of business. 

Another common story that was reported on then was the loss of an entertainment option for local business to offer for guests, like some of the big players in town would take clients to a Predators game to socialize and try to close a deal in a non-business setting. 

The studies on this topic almost always only talk about taxes and ticket sales, but never the economic ripples that a stadium creates. Parking is a big one, there are all kind of companies that make money off of the teams like printing companies, and digital graphics companies that do scoreboard videos and animations. Local suppliers for food and beverage. Many stadiums now include local restaurants inside the venue. The arena in Nashville for example has multiple smaller music and meeting venues separate from the main bowl. They also all employed hundreds of individuals who then spend that money locally. 

I agree that there are definitely some terrible stadium deals, and there are cities and states that invest too much into stadiums and give too many tax breaks to stadiums. But there is definitely a level of city/state involvement that makes sense for both sides.",2026-02-08 01:19:05,reddit

What I don’t like is when rich owners cry poor when the city/town/village/burg/hamlet/holler won’t pay for upgrades, or move the team when it gets shitty.  (See Seattle Supersonics.)  And the lies our city/town/village/burg/hamlet/holler told us that we would see economic benefits?  Still waiting.  We have a hockey team here who promised hotels and entertainment around the arena in 1999.  One restaurant so far.  And that one keeps changing hands.

1qypukz,Choice-of-SteinsGate,"**THE MASHED POTATO INCIDENT**

Donald Trump doesn't like when this story is told.

According to Mary Trump, this is a legendary Trump family story that she describes as an important moment when the president received a scarring taste of humiliation while at the same time discovering his appetite for humiliating others.

It happened when Donald was seven (keep this in mind). Donald had been tormenting his brother Robert at dinner, as he apparently did often. He refused to listen to his mother's pleas to stop. 

Desperate to bring the fighting to an end, a14-year-old Freddy, who is Mary’s father and Donald's older brother, took matters into his own hands and dumped a bowl of mashed potatoes on Donald's head. Everyone in the room, except Donald, burst into laughter.

&gt; ""It was the first time Donald had been humiliated by someone he even then believed to be beneath him. He hadn't understood that humiliation was a weapon that could be wielded by only one person in a fight"", Mary Trump wrote.

&gt; ""From then on, he would never allow himself to feel that feeling again. From them on, he would wield the weapon, never be at the sharp end of it"", he never forgot the incident, Mary said.

Donald Trump would hold a deep-seated grudge against his brother from then on, and would continue to be a relentless asshole towards him for the rest of his life.

When his older sister Maryanne brought up the mashed potato incident at a gathering at the White House in 2017, the president *""listened with his arms tightly crossed and a scowl on his face""... ""He clearly still felt the sting of that long-ago humiliation"".*

There’s one particular quote from Trump that really brings it all together.

Around the time when Trump first received the Republican frontrunner nom, he was interviewed by a famous biographer, and during a rare moment of self reflection, Trump admitted to this biographer:

&gt; ""When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same. The temperament is not that different"".

Coincidentally, first graders are usually around the age of ***seven years old.***

With such a candid remark, Trump may have revealed that the mashed potato incident is a source of trauma for him and perhaps even the beginning of a life long pattern of behavior. 

That same reporter also managed to get some insight into Donald's behavior from his ex wives:

&gt; ""The little boy that still wants attention,"" explained Marla Maples, Trump's second wife. She wasn't the only one who thought so.

&gt; ""He wants to be noticed,"" said Ivana Trump, wife No. 1, who recalled sending Trump into a fit of rage by skiing past him on a hill in Aspen, Colorado. Mr. Trump stopped, took off his skis and walked off the trail

&gt; ""He could not take it, that I could do something better than he did,"" she recalled

Trump has the mental and emotional intelligence of a child. He cannot cope with feelings of humiliation, failure, embarrassment, or defeat; these are his greatest fears.  

He is a petty, vindictive, malignant narcissist who seeks out constant attention, approval and applause from those willing to give it, sincerely or not. This helps him internalize these fears and validate the delusions he has about himself.

To Trump, life is a zero sum game—no matter the circumstances. Which is why he is so obsessed with ""winning, winning, winning.""

In his mind, Trump is *always* the winner, even in the face of irrefutable loss. His ego cannot handle any other story. His deranged and compulsive need to be the winner and the constant center of attention is a response to his own deep seated insecurities and fears of being humiliated or defeated. A pathology that was no doubt reinforced by his role model, Roy Cohn, who taught him to always claim victory, no matter the outcome.

This is why he so often uses pretentious and grandiose language to describe himself. Why he is always ""the best"" or the most successful [blank] in history.

It's why he is so obsessed with his ratings, his image and reputation. Why even when confronted with facts and data that expose his waning popularity, he has no other choice but to instinctively deny it.

It's why he cries ""fake news* when encountering any criticism. Why he lashes out like a child bully when a reporter asks a legitimate question that tries to hold him accountable or highlight one of his many inconsistencies.

Perhaps more importantly, it's why every election or competition that he's ever lost was conveniently ""rigged"" against him. It's why he never concedes defeat, and his only recourse is to accuse his opponents of ""cheating."" 

It's why he is incapable of accepting responsibility for his own failures or mistakes. Why every investigation is a ""witch hunt."" Why every journalist that does not shower him with praise is ""nasty,"" ""cruel,"" and ""bad at their job.""

It's why he mocks, belittles and taunts his political opponents, and why he resorts to slander, insults or threats towards others who won't cater to his delicate sensibilities, who won't pledge their undying fealty to him, or compromise their integrity for the sake of his pride and political aspirations.

It's why every judge or person in a position of authority who presents an obstacle to Trump's unconstitutional agenda is an ""activist"" or ""radical leftist"" who must be removed from power.

It's why he is weaponizing the justice department and every power of the federal government to seek retribution against all those who previously wronged him.

It's also why he threatens the careers of talk show hosts who tell jokes at his expense.

Let's also not forget that Trump is a notorious ""cheater"" himself. He is a habitual adulterer, a corrupt conman, a tax fraud, a financial pariah, a grifter, a pathological liar and demagogue who preaches faux-populist rhetoric despite being a kleptocratic thief who picks the American people's pockets while he shamelessly monetizes his presidency to the tune of billions.

He lies about his wealth, he lies about his accomplishments, he lies about his opponents, he lies about his crimes, he lies about his intentions, he lies about his popularity, he lies about himself, he lies about everything, and of course, he lies about elections.

While Donald Trump was accusing his opponents of ""rigging"" the 2020 election, he was scheming to overturn the results of that same free and fair election; which subsequently led to the events of January 6th.

Trump even lies about his golf game.

It's no secret that Donald Trump cheats at golf. He's been caught many times, even by professional athletes.

He brags about fabricated and inflated numbers of tournament wins. He lies about his scores, he sabotages his opponents and he's been accused of defrauding the sport entirely.

Donald Trump must protect his fragile ego by surrounding himself with flatterers and loyalists, by constructing a reality or a safe space where he is free from humiliation, shame, embarrassment, failure... Mashed potatoes.

His pathology is rooted in a lifetime of lies, enablement, narcissistic delusions, unanswerable fraud, and compulsive cheating—all behaviors that stem from deep, lingering fears. To Trump, losing an election or being humiliated by his opponents and critics amounts to a vivid and chilling reliving of ""The Mashed Potato Incident"". His *""Rose Spud*"" if you will.",2026-02-07 22:54:21,reddit

""Not-so-fun fact: SCOTUS cannot legally grant someone immunity. Just like SCOTUS cannot legally amend the Constitution. They have done both of these things but it is not legal for them to do so.

The problem is that while the country treats everything SCOTUS decides as inherently legal these things will go unchallenged. But SCOTUS being able to essentially define their own legality is very much the same vein of argument that the executive can essentially define its own legality.

These are obviously nonsense concepts that go against everything the law is supposed to be. In fact the concept of immunity itself is legally dubious in that it is only ever applicable in a few very specific cases where explicitly defined, and even in those cases it isn't defined as such.

When you grant immunity to a person who is capable of washing away the punishment of a crime via pardon you basically just created a King. Because they can commission a crime, pardon away the punishment of the crimes they commissioned while also enjoying immunity for said crimes yourself. Which is essentially where we are because Donald Trump did just that. He committed high crimes that could potentially rise to the level of treason and pardoned away the punishment of those who he commissioned for those crimes. Him having immunity is a blasphemy on everything America and the concept of law stands for.

But wait there's more. This hyper-conservative SCOTUS basically threaded a needle in such a way as they get to define that immunity. So naturally if a Republican is President they are immune but if a Democrat is President they are not. See how this works? See why it is so functionally absurd that SCOTUS can ""grant"" immunity? That's not a power the Constitution gives them, hell it's not a power the Constitution gives anyone INCLUDING the President. Even the pardon power has never been interpreted as immunity. Being pardoned just washes away the punishment, it doesn't wash away the crime or the record of it.""",2026-02-07 23:18:42,reddit
1qypht5,Internal-War-9947,"Very very good point.         


&gt;&gt;When you grant immunity to a person who is capable of washing away the punishment of a crime via pardon you basically just created a King.



Only thing I'd add in, is that what's going on with Trump &amp; the SC, goes beyond the powers of a king. Even the most powerful of kings were not immune! They could get away with a lot obviously, but I dare say even kings were not getting the coddling we've seen with Trump. They had oversight from the churches, other nobility, &amp; back then, they did have to worry about keeping the people happy... Or else ...          


I found it highly concerning when the right suddenly started this trend of claiming ""we were never *really* a democracy anyway"", &amp; the way they blow off that he treats the role of president as if it's like a kingship.

1qypbxo,Choice-of-SteinsGate,"Trump is and always has been a racist.

Here are just SOME examples:

In the 70s, The Justice department sued Donald Trump, his father, and Trump management for violating the fair housing act and discriminating against black renters. They were forced to settle.

It was reported by a former employee at Trump’s Castle that:

&gt; “When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,” Brown said. “It was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: They put us all in the back.” 

This took place in the 80s, but it might as well have happened in the 50s...

During the contentious ""Central Park Five"" case, where four black teenager were wrongly accused and convicted of raping a jogger in NYC, Trump took out an ad in the local paper. In it he demanded, ""BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!”

The teen's convictions were later vacated due to DNA evidence. Trump never apologized for his racist and presumptuous behavior, and to this day still believes, or at least insists that they were guilty. 

A former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino describes Trump criticizing a black accountant:

&gt; ""Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” 

Trump later said in a 1997 Playboy interview that “the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.”

That same Casino also ended up having to pay a $200,000 fine because it ""transferred Black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a big-time gambler’s prejudices.""

Then there's Trump's role in pushing false rumors about Obama not being born in the U.S. Trump claimed that he even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's origins. Trump's ""birtherism"" movement is widely criticized as racist.

Trump also suggested that Obama was not qualified enough to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School; insinuating that a black man would never be accepted into these schools based on his merits.

Trump also infamously referred to African and predominantly black countries as ""shithole countries.""

Trump has hesitated, or has downright refused to condemn white supremacist groups (""Stand back and stand by!""). He has also been caught retweeting posts from prominent white nationalists and neo-Nazis during his presidential campaign. 

His ""law and order"" rhetoric is riddled with racist dog whistles.

He constantly stereotypes black people in public. Who knows what he's saying behind closed doors.

Leading white supremacist figures have praised him on a number of different occasions, and have even referred to him as their voice and leader.

In a 1990 report, Ivana Trump told her lawyer that Donald kept Hitler's speeches by his bedside.

It's been reported that Trump said immigrants from Haiti ""all have AIDS"" and that immigrants from Nigeria wouldn't ""go back to their huts"" if they ever reached American soil. 

Trump told black and brown members of Congress to ""go back"" to the countries they came from.

Trump's birtherism movement has even targeted Kamala Harris.

During a season of The Apprentice, Trump fired a black contestant for being ""overeducated.""

&gt; “...you haven’t done anything,” Trump said on the show. “At some point you have to say ‘that’s enough.'”

But during another season of The Apprentice, Trump fired a different black contestant because he was ""inarticulate.""

And look, I haven't even scratched the surface here, especially considering how these examples only showcase Trump's dehumanizing and racist conduct towards black people. There isn't enough time in the world to address all of his racist and bigoted behavior towards other groups of people like Arabs, Jews, Latinos, Asians, Mexicans, Muslims, etc, let alone enough characters in a social media post.",2026-02-07 22:56:31,reddit

The post was posted late Thursday night, backlash was almost immediate. The question I have was why the delay before it was deleted. During the conversation with Sen Scott, Trump acknowledged the post was a mistake and would be removed. Why couldn’t it have been removed before their phone call? Did the White House want more views before taking it down? Did they want the people to see their vote messaging and the racist smear before removing it? Is it so difficult to remove a post on Truth Social, that it takes some time before it is removed?

1qyp0tf,B-Z_B-S,"Excerpt from the article: ""Massie said he knew his time had run out, but he wanted a little more time to ""defend my wife."" Trump recently published an [insulting social media post](https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/2018426425393447406) about Massie's wife, Carolyn Grace Moffa, that was reposted on X by Gallrein. No speakers at the dinner had referenced his wife, Massie said, but ""there's literally nobody at this event who just hasn't seen the president's tweet.""

""They didn't want me to speak anymore, and (Osborne) came up and grabbed the microphone,"" Massie said. ""He just snatched it out of there.""

Some of it might have been due to confusion, the congressman speculated. He was talking about the speaker of the U.S. House when he was cut off, but he didn't specifically reference Mike Johnson, the Louisiana Republican who holds that role in the nation's Capitol. Osborne holds a similar title as speaker of the Kentucky House in Frankfort.

But he also speculated political difference between him and Osborne may have played into it.

""I think if it had been Senator McConnell, that he could have spoken extemporaneously for 20 minutes,"" Massie said. ""Obviously if Speaker Osborne had liked what I was saying, he wouldn't have shut me down like that.""

A representative for Osborne did not immediately provide a statement or make the speaker available for comment.""",2026-02-07 20:55:31,reddit

Biden inherited an economic mess—a democratic tradition going back to Carter—and things didn't improve immediately. Numbers were going in the right direction, though.

Trump could have coasted on those improving numbers, adding specifically targeted tariffs to boost our industries while keeping our exports strong and not pissing off our allies.

With immigration, Trump had majority support when he was elected. He could have done some targeted enforcement actions, parade around a few members of whatever gang we are supposed to be scared about, while securing the border and the majority would have eaten it all up, including the hispanics that helped turn some bluish areas of Texas red in 2024.

Instead, he gave the Santa Monica nazi control of immigration and his approval on that has nosedived. Four of the five new red districts Texas created that sparked this whole midterm redistricting push are majority hispanic. 

Had Trump not turned ICE into masked thugs terrorizing the streets, the republicans would easily win those seats. Thanks to Trump, they look much more competitive.

His push for redistricting awoke the sleeping woke dragon, pushing blue states, that had gotten out of the gerrymandering game in the name of fairness, to jump back in with a vengeance.

1qyo715,OnDrugsTonight,"It's astonishing, really. We are quite likely to lose our Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, over this. Not because he himself had anything to do with Epstein, but because he appointed Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the United States. The reason Mandelson was appointed was that he was seen as a ""Trump whisperer"". And the reason for *that* was that Trump and Mandelson were ""moving in the same circles"". Those circles, as has now become very clear from the files, were the ugly, filthy circles of the Epstein ""ecosystem"". 

Starmer has already had a pretty rough ride with the public and not a lot of support from his own party anyway, so the fact that he's shown such a catastrophic lack of judgment may very well be the last straw that forces him into resignation. The knives are certainly out for him, both in the media and across the political spectrum.

""In a report published Saturday morning, the *Times* cited several people with knowledge of the events who spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying Patel and several others did not want to produce a report that would go against the president's claim Good ""violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer"" who shot her last month in [Minneapolis](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/minneapolis) as she was driving her car.""

""This, according to the *Times*, preceded the Department of Justice ([DOJ](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/doj)) presenting ""alternative approaches"" to investigating the case, much of which federal prosecutors in [Minnesota](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/minnesota) viewed as legally dubious and potentially dangerous given the high tensions in the state at the time. Ultimately, half a dozen federal prosecutors, including U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota [Joseph H. Thompson, decided to resign](https://www.newsweek.com/minnesota-prosecutors-resign-over-doj-renee-good-investigation-report-11353997).""

""Thompson and his colleagues resigned from their positions in mid-January approximately a week after Good's shooting, with reporting at the time indicating the prosecutors had disagreements over how to handle the [investigation](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/investigation) into the shooting.""

""Now, the *Times* has provided some details around the decision and disagreement, with anonymous sources saying it was due to orders from Washington.""
___________________________________________________________________________________

""Prosecutors Began Investigating Renee Good’s Killing. Washington Told Them to Stop.""

""Federal prosecutors had a warrant to collect evidence from Ms. Good’s vehicle, but Trump administration leaders said to drop it. About a dozen prosecutors have departed, leaving the Minnesota U.S. attorney’s office in turmoil.""

""Hours after an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Good inside her S.U.V. on a Minneapolis street last month, a senior federal prosecutor in Minnesota sought a warrant to search the vehicle for evidence in what he expected would be a standard civil rights investigation into the agent’s use of force.""

""But later that week, as F.B.I. agents equipped with a signed warrant prepared to document blood spatter and bullet holes in Ms. Good’s S.U.V., they received orders to stop, according to several people with knowledge of the events who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.""

"".....They urged the prosecutors to instead investigate Ms. Good’s partner, who had been with Ms. Good on the morning of the shooting, confronting immigration agents in their Minneapolis neighborhood.""

""Several of the career federal prosecutors in Minnesota, including Mr. Thompson, balked at the new approach, which they viewed as legally dubious and incendiary in a state where anger over a federal immigration crackdown was already boiling over. Mr. Thompson and five others left the office in protest, setting off a broader wave of resignations that has left Minnesota’s U.S. attorney’s office severely understaffed and in crisis. Officials have not said whether they ultimately obtained a new warrant to search the vehicle.""

""Some career prosecutors in the office, which has a long reputation for \[winning complex and high-profile cases\](https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-honors-department-justice-employees-and-partners-2022), were unsettled by a memo that Attorney General \[Pam Bondi issued in February 2025\](https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1388521/dl?inline), signaling that the Department of Justice would “zealously advance” Mr. Trump’s policies.""

""Not long after Ms. Good’s death, senior administration officials were quick to blame her for the shooting. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, called Ms. Good a \[domestic terrorist\](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/trump-minnesota-protesters-domestic-terrorists.html), language that Vice President \[JD Vance echoed\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LhojCCx26Q).""

""Even in a rules-shattering administration, the hasty conclusions about the shooting shocked federal prosecutors in Minnesota. Veteran lawyers in the office watched numerous videos of the shooting. Virtually all presumed there would be a civil rights investigation into the use of force, an approach often used in shootings involving law enforcement officers.""

""At one point, Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol leader who was the face of the administration’s immigration crackdown in Los Angeles, Chicago and Minneapolis, called federal prosecutors, pressing them to charge demonstrators with crimes. When a prosecutor asked what the operation’s end goal was, several people familiar with the call recalled Mr. Bovino saying that he did not intend to “calm it down,” but instead, he said, “We’re going to put it down.”

""Soon after, \[Ms. Bondi told Fox News\](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-federal-minnesota-prosecutors-officially-terminated-after-dispute-over-ice-shooting-probe) that the lawyers who left “suddenly decided they didn’t want to support the men and women at ICE.” Referring to them as members of the “deep state,” Ms. Bondi said she had fired them, resulting in the loss of months of unused vacation they had banked.""

""The top fraud experts in the office left. So did Melinda Williams, a veteran in prosecuting sex crimes and child pornography cases. Thomas Calhoun-Lopez, who oversaw the major violent crimes unit, also departed.""

“It will take years to build the contacts in state and local law enforcement that has been lost,” Mr. Luger said.""

""The lawyer, Jim Stolley, the outgoing chief counsel for ICE in the state, has not publicly addressed the circumstances of his departure. Starting this week, emails sent to his government account generated an automated response noting that he had “retired from public service.”

""The top federal judge in Minnesota, Patrick J. Schiltz, recently criticized ICE for violating more than 100 judicial orders. Those orders include several rulings demanding that the government release people from custody.""

1qyo4km,Dismal-Bullfrog-7851,"It's wild how the leader's words are taken as gospel, even when they contradict reality or even themselves. The real issue here is the fear of contradicting the leader, not the actual truth. It's like they're more worried about pleasing him than doing their jobs.",2026-02-08 15:24:13,reddit

1qyo4km,ScalesAsunder,"There is no public, documented evidence (such as communications, memos, or official orders released publicly) that unambiguously proves the FBI/DOJ halted or altered the investigation solely to protect Trump’s narrative.

The claim comes from sources familiar with internal discussions. Meaning it’s second-hand reporting from people who weren’t authorized to speak publicly, but it is not official DOJ documentation or court-verified evidence.

The claim and the main point of this article is attributed to anonymous sources.  FYI.",2026-02-07 22:27:24,reddit
1qyo4km,MrOdekuun,"I just hope you understand, deep in your heart, that you are a terrible and disgusting person. Your “facts and logic” shtick is very transparently based on neither.

You have been justifying *murder* for a month straight and have the *gall* to complain about name-calling.

Thanks for your wonderful PSA, though.",2026-02-07 22:48:05,reddit
1qyo4km,ScalesAsunder,"There are people who immediately label others as Nazis or murderers and believe those they disagree with should suffer for their views. I am not one of those people.

I lean toward evidence and waiting for all the facts before drawing conclusions. If that makes me “disgusting,” so be it.

And I’m not complaining about name-calling, it’s just where many conversations end up when views differ. That says a lot about the individual, not the argument.",2026-02-07 22:58:04,reddit
1qyo4km,MrOdekuun,"They are murderers though. I don’t even have to generalize ICE as a whole for that point - you’ve defended the individuals directly involved in murders in broad daylight, on video, from several angles. To deny that and then pretend to be some empirical observer is pathetic.

You do not care about truth and you pretending otherwise is obvious to anyone paying the slightest attention.

You complain about protests interfering with the constitutional rights of others while DHS tramples the first and fourth amendments continually - indefinite detention, state-approved racial profiling, attacking peoples for recording, attacking people asking agents to identify themselves, compiling lists of protesters with the direct assistance of corporations owned by oligarchs. 

You complain about fascist comparisons while the police state’s budget is higher than any point in history despite trends of lower and lower crime leading up to this appropriation of taxes. You complain about fascist comparisons as some of there largest tech corporations in the world cooperate with and largely control domestic surveillance tools with zero accountability so long as they “donate” to Trump.

You’re not stupid, though. I’ll give you that much. Why I went with “disgusting.” You see these things and *you do not care*. You don’t care about investigations into these murder being blocked. You don’t care about DHS relocating murderers to other states like a bishop hiding rapist priests. 

You say you reserve judgment for facts yet ignore these obstructions to investigations, ignore the administration inventing completely fictional versions of these events immediately as they happen. Do you eat those up too, despite video evidence? Despite DHS posting altered images? Despite audio of ICE agents enjoying themselves executing a completely restrained citizen?

I know there is no point to saying any of this to you. You’re on a mission to deny all of these things. Not just denying them, but supporting them. You’re pretending to be a champion of truth and facts, but it is clear as day that your main motivation is hatred. You’re not slick. We *all* see it.",2026-02-09 00:49:40,reddit
1qyo4km,AlsoCommiePuddin,Right. It wasn't presented to you as a scene in an NCIS-style primtime slop procedural so it simply didn't happen. Right? That's the bullshit MAGA defense for everything.,2026-02-08 15:42:32,reddit
