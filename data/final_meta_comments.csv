What has the McSweeney strategy entailed exactly? What is it based on? Well, we can see that every day. It is to punch your friends and placate your enemies. Yesterday’s nonsensical asylum-taxi policy was a classic example. Every time the home secretary rises to speak, it is with the express intention of smacking liberals and progressives around. And that rhetoric is not by chance and is not an outburst. It is vivid, persistent, a strategy, a concerted effort to secure the admiration of nationalist reactionaries in the hope they might one day vote Labour, which they never will. What has it got them? Do they have any new allies? Obviously not. The right despises Starmer. Hasn’t made a blind bit of difference. But it has liquidated any support base which the prime minister might now have benefited from. It has alienated anyone who might previously have given him the benefit of the doubt: liberals, progressives, the hard-left, the soft-left, the centre-left, among voters, among the public, on the government benches, in the Commons tea rooms, within the comment pages of the newspapers. The problems are  that while McSweeney and Starmer have dug Labour into a hole, it's not clear either that their successors would be any better, or that even that good successors would be able to extract them from the hole. They came into power without any coherent program, without getting the voters to buy in to any significant policies, and after making impossible commitments not to raise taxes. Two years in, it's a bit late to start trying to decide what you wanted power for. But possibly the successors might start doing a bit less damage, if they try to shore up leftist and  liberal support rather than continue the doomed quest to out-fash Reform",5 favorites,"['https://iandunt.substack.com/p/starmers-moment-of-reckoning-373', '/favorited/2/8811796']",2026-02-09 08:26:00,Monday

I think the identity of the right is the issue here. As Dunt identifies, the right includes a whole bunch of people but key among them for both major parties, and now for Reform, are the Red Wall voters. Previously Labour on economics grounds but now polling on the right on social (ie racist) grounds. They had both sets of views already but now vote one rather than the other. Labour has been desperate to get them back onside since Brexit revealed the potential for immigration (or racism) as a wedge issue that could shift them away from voting en masse for Labour. This group is different from the tory-voting working class and the rabid always racist leaning people. Maybe they can be re-won? Starmer has been doing his best to dog whistle them onside but Labour's lousy performance on the economy (and in fairness they inherited a pretty fucked economy) means the other tool that might be available isn't there to help shift them back. Are there any solutions that don't involve a good dose of Reform to help with that? When all those flirting with Reform find out that Nige doesn't have any interest in making them better off it may shift thinking, but by then it will be too late to avoid putting us all in the shit. Of course, on the other side the racist facing policies of Labour mean they are losing people off the other side of the party - the ones who voted socially for Labour, and since the Greens bucked their ideas up, they have become more attractive and are picking these up. How sticky are those for the Greens?

Boycotting a company that makes a profit is pretty simple in theory. You stop buying their products, they make less revenue, their profits are cut, they realise this campaign is the reason, and they take the action that the campaign wants. But companies like OpenAI and Anthropic make a loss on every transaction. If you stop using their products, their costs reduce by more than their revenues, so their losses are reduced. In direct financial terms, they benefit from the boycott. But of course, these companies want to make a loss in the short term. The goal is that when they have enough volume or market share, they want to raise their prices and move into profitability. So maybe your boycott harms that goal. But all this assumes that the companies have a viable long term business model. If AI is not a bubble, the AI companies will theoretically look at this boycott and somehow force Trump to abolish ICE in order to remove the boycott and move back into making a short term loss / long term profit. But if AI is actually a bubble, the boycott will burst that bubble and the companies will go bust. If they're bust, they no longer have any leverage over Trump and cannot force him to abolish ICE. So given certain assumptions, this campaign could work in theory. Those assumptions are: 1. AI is a viable long term business not a bubble 2. The AI companies have significant influence over Trump 3. This campaign will be widely adopted",1 favorite,['/favorited/2/8810996'],2026-02-05 23:05:00,Thursday

Andrew Coyne often (and rightly) points out (https://sutherlandhousebooks.com/product/the-crisis-of-canadian-democracy/) that the 'methods' category is a non-partisan problem.

Do shit that makes the USA look good internationally, build an international trading block to out grow the enemy, make people in countries want their country to join the international trade block. Even human rights at home was part of this.  You get rid of your blatantly racist policies so the Soviets couldn't use them as a weapon to turn most of the third world against you; if the third world joined the Soviet world, their trade block would outweigh Americas, and it could then outgrow America's trade block. You still do racism, because that is cheap votes, but when you do racism you hide it behind code words.  Everyone understands the code words, but foreigners don't always, so it serves its purpose. So this democratic capitalist alliance holds, and the Democratic and Republican party fight over other stuff.  Marginally more or less racism, more or less taxes, etc.  But the military industrial complex, the general foreign policy, those stay pretty stable between parties: they don't swing many votes, and the Washington consensus thinks they are needed to defeat the Soviets. The cold war is over.  There is no longer a strong domestic political block that cares about the health of the empire.  Enough capitalists look at China and Russia and say ""there are rich people there, I just have to make sure when we go authoritarian I'm on the right side and bingo bango I got it made"".

As a dual citizen who migrated here in 2001 and naturalised in 2007 I've been meaning to make a submission to this, but got caught up in personal stuff. I will now. I can scarcely imagine a parallel life in which I would be, at this point, still five years away from residency , let alone citizenship, and yet that's what these bastards have in mind for fellow human beings from Planet Earth: spending their entire working lives under that kind of uncertainty and disenfranchisement. And to be clear, I see the proposed ten years until Indefinite Leave to Remain as just as reprehensible. The four years that I had to endure in my thirties felt hard enough. It takes someone who's never had their fate in the hands of the Home Office to blithely tack on extra years of waiting at a whim. Unfortunately, that's most UK voters and their blinkered representatives. As for the ratcheting up of fees and income thresholds over the years, it's just as reprehensible. Supposedly it's to make immigrants pay for all this welfare we're using. What the UK doesn't take into account is that when it gets an adult immigrant, it's getting someone whose entire education and upbringing was provided by another country. Australia paid for my primary schooling, my secondary schooling, my undergraduate degree and my doctorate. I did do a one-year masters in the UK along the way, but my family paid the international student fees and living costs for it. When I turned up here in 2001 and started paying visa fees and taxes, the UK got all of that for free. It's true that my kids have been educated by the UK—paid for via the council taxes I've been paying for 25 years. Those kids are going to spend their working lives paying the taxes that prop up the pensions for all the elderly voters who keep voting against them and their interests. What a deal. If you can't already guess, I'm feeling bitter that this gateway bullshit from a Labour government that I helped to vote into power is going to usher in a subsequent government's abolition of dual citizenship, and at the very point I'm approaching retirement age I'm going to have to choose between the two countries that have shaped my entire life, and whether or not I get to live close to my own children and any kids they might have. And Labour figure they can get away with it because First Past the Post keeps voters like me hostage: if we take a chance on voting for the Greens or the Lib Dems in a General Election, we're risking throwing the seat to the Tories or nowadays to the Re-Formed Tories.

In my elderly lifetime, ""British"" has always meant anyone mixed anything living in Great Britain (the British Isles includes Ireland cos British literally anciently means Celtic). So if someone's living here for a long time without a passport, like working and paying taxes or deeply involved for a few years, they're British in my mind and I believe in general parlance. I'm white and this is the first time in my life since the mid 1970s that other whites have openly been racist (most racism in the street is if you see a black person, so you don't experience it if you're white normally). The main problem is normally racism is funny: the drunk ranting at the 'small boats' at the bus stop who ended in 'i hate the fucking french' - if you're drunk i guess small boats from france are full of french.... The old man going on about the problems caused by 'all those Zulus' and me thinking for a hot minute that kwaZulu Natal (? the ones funded by the ANC who bombed bus stations in South Africa during apartheid) were somehow hiding out in the local area and then doing the maths and realising the Boer Wars were his parents' experience.... It's just so dumb it's hard to take seriously. What are these people even on? Even people who don't think white replacement theory is real (tabby is dominant and all cats breed as they wish, in cat years for millenia, but not all mongrel cats are tabby - it's a minority, though if you include tabby bits it's a majority - easy proof), but say 'one tenth of the population is new' or similar - i can't understand the problem. A huge influx in a small community yes: in a small community, you know everyone inside out, so it's like a boatload of strangers joining a family. But somewhere over 2,000 people, or in the country as a whole? I don't know 99.99999% of the country, adding a few more people i don't know won't change anything will it? I genuinely don't get it. How is it even an issue? For some schools in some areas, for particular people dealing with particular jobs yes, otherwise why? Same as trans.

Even golf would make more sense as an ingroup/outgroup argument. Or motor sports: now that is boring. I hate grass, i'm really pro moss, I even manage to convert a few people: but I can't see it becoming a national political division.

However, education on how to use these tools and what they can and cannot do is immensely valuable and something that should be introduced everywhere. I'm a strong advocate for AI/LLM harm reduction education so I'm hoping this hits that brief, intentionally or not. Purely anecdotal, but the smartest people I know tend to not engage with AI very much (outside of mandatory work requirements, basic optimisations of existing work, and just for silly fun) because they understand the limitations, risks, and motivations behind the technology. That seems to be the prevailing mood here on the blue as well: AI is dumb and bad and it will fail. All that might be true, but in the meantime I also know people who live their lives via ChatGPT using it for legal counsel, psychological support, and emotional connection, without any understanding of how the underlying technology is purely designed to keep them engaged to increase time on platform. You can blame these people for their own choices if you like, but they are poorly educated on this matter fighting against billions of dollars of research aimed at manipulating them.

A free, full-day, year round child care program for all 2 year olds in New York City. Eligibility criteria is simple, mirroring New York City public schools, and includes, name, date of birth, and proof of address–no further questions asked. What does 2-Care cost? $1.3 billion annually at scale, which accounts for required staffing ratios for health and safety, as well as living wages for staff. [...] Why Now? The affordability crisis in New York City extends far beyond families living in poverty, creating an economic burden that affects middle-class and even upper-middle-class households. Full-time child care for a 2-yearold in New York City costs roughly $23,400 annually—more than the cost of full-time tuition at CUNY. It is estimated that a household would have to make $334,000 to afford the cost of care for a two year old in New York City, “four times the median family income or the equivalent of 10 minimum wage jobs.” New York City alone lost $23 billion in economic activity in 2022 because parents dropped out of the workforce or cut back working hours due to child care issues. The high cost of child care is a primary driver for families leaving New York City. Families with children under the age of six are twice as likely to leave New York City. Providing care for 2 year olds supports them at a crucial time in their brain development. How can 2-Care be implemented? Provider capacity must be built up to scale 2-Care effectively. This includes converting existing child care programs to participate in 2-Care, creating new capacity in child care deserts, and investing in the workforce, particularly family child care providers. A 4 year rollout plan should focus first on high-need districts with the most families of 2-year-olds in poverty, and then quickly expand to ensure that every borough has access based on economic need and child care capacity. Ideally New York City could roll out 2-Care over the next four years. By better utilizing existing state and federal funding, and using newly dedicated city tax levy and state dollars, New York City could scale up 2-Care to meet universal demand. and then ramping to 5yos (https://www.united4childcare.org/upcny) ... Birth to 5 When a family is ready to put their child into care – anytime after the baby is six weeks old and up until their child is eligible to begin kindergarten – they would have access to the universal public child care system. There would be no restrictions on access – all children means all children. Nearby No family should have to travel more than 15 minutes for quality child care. Easy to apply For families, accessing child care should be as simple as enrolling in public K-12 education.

For most of the post WWII era, this simply is not true. Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush, and the corresponding congressional Republican leadership were not out there weaponizimg the DOJ to go after their political opposition (Bush II you can definitely see cracks start to form). They weren't attacking the independence of the Fed or career positions in executive branch governmental agencies. For the most part they stood against progress in civil rights but they did so more or less softly and were definitely not trying to aggressively roll them back the way the Trump-era Republican party has. And Bush II, strangely, was really good on racial issues and strongly wanted to reform the immigration system in a way that is anathema to the current party (however it was widespread rejection of that stance within the party that built some momentum for the current nativist wave). I'm not saying the John Birch types haven't always been around, but they were always treated like the embarrassing relative, and certainly not allowed to drive. There were a few noteworthy exceptions, Hoover, McCarthy, etc, but in general, these folks were kept to the side, and polite society carried the day. That is not where we are today. IMO what happened (in very broad strokes) is A. that the passing of the generations that remembered the Great Depression and WWII meant that there were no longer people in power within all levels of conservative politics who would push back against the demagoguery of the far right, and B. that the very real progress made by various civil rights campaigns combined with dislocation caused by neoliberalism to create the fertile ground for a revanchist backlash, which C. was exploited and amplified by a foreign power (Russia) working in coordination with increasingly extreme right-wing domestic billionaires, notably the Adelsons and Mercers, to exploit advances in communication technology to destroy the rhetorical underpinnings of center right ideology. But Dick Cheney (before he died, may he suffer for his crimes), Karl Rove, George Will and even Bill freaking Kristol all hate what's happening. In a lot of ways, they hate it more than the squish centrist Dem leadership, because unlike centrist Dems, they actually have beliefs and principles, and what's happening now is absolutely not within a vision of constitutional order. There's more to this -- the inherently authoritarian and monopolist structure of Capitalism and in particular the owning and coopting of media companies deserve special mention. But broadly, the demise of a conservative party that supports constitutional order is a huge, probably overdetermined problem, and it is one we have to understand if we are going to constructively grapple with where we are politically, not just in the US, but all throughout Western democracies",26 favorites,['/favorited/2/8802792'],2026-01-14 04:53:00,Wednesday

There are several different outcomes possible and while none of them are good, some are worse than others. It could be a bellwether for the broader advance of fascism and how fast that will be moving. Even if Tisza and Magyar defeat Fidesz/Orbán, it would simply be the least bad outcome: another conservative party in power, just with less overt corruption and without open defiance of rule of law. Fidesz has so thoroughly reconfigured the bureaucracy and the media landscape that Tisza/Magyar wouldn't get much done. Fidesz would most likely sabotage Tisza for five years while refining its message and tools to take power again in the next election. There is also the possibility that Russia could attempt a rapid and catastrophic influence campaign to swing the election Orbán's way. As the RLI article points out, this may already be under way.

It is not ""whitewashing Nixon"" to observe that the rest of the Republican Party shut him down over that. Republican Senators were going to vote to convict him of impeachment, if they got the chance. There's a really asinine bit of disinformation that Everybody Knows, which is that the Founders did not envision political Parties as being a thing in American politics. Which it's pretty curious that Everybody believes this, since aside from Washington the Founders who stayed active in politics promptly formed opposing Parties, creating the First Party System (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Party_System) . What the Madison and Hamilton and Washington meant when they talked about the dangers of ""faction"" was not partisan politics as it was practiced for the first 180 years or so of the Republic. Because they were historically literate and acquainted with classical Greek thinking about politics, they knew about one of the main failure modes of republics, namely that one partisan group would come to value loyalty to the group over loyalty to the Republic. The Greeks called this ""stasis,"" which made it into English as ""faction."" The usual endpoint of a republic that has devolved into stasis is that a Party that has abandoned loyalty to its host polity invites foreign intervention against its domestic opponents. This generally results in a level of foreign influence that is incompatible with the continued independent existence of the affected polity. Why/how this process gets started is one of those questions that probably has unique answers in every instance",11 favorites,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Party_System', '/favorited/2/8802828']",2026-01-14 07:00:00,Wednesday

Why did the right become more and not less attractive to voters over time? Reagan seems like a portent of things to come now and not the one-off ""revolution"" we thought he would be at the time. I think the real answer (which I rarely see well-explained online) is: income inequality. In this I'm basically following the economist Piketty, whose book, ""Capital in the 21st Century,"" is a must read. In brief: the rate at which capital owners accumulate capital is faster than the rate at which workers can earn it. To be less brief: When the rate of return on capital (r) is greater than the rate of economic growth (g), wealth accumulates faster for the rich than for the rest of society, increasing inequality. When r > g, inherited wealth becomes a dominant force, leading to a ""patrimonial capitalism"" where social mobility stagnates. The mid-20th century's lower inequality was an exception, not the rule, and the 19th-century pattern of extreme wealth concentration is re-emerging. As a general trend, that was also the pattern in the 18th century, etc... I believe this trend will continue, following the research. Capital owners will continue to accumulate more capital relative to the rest of society and will advance right-wing politics even further. What does that mean for us? For one thing, there's no respite coming. It will ""get worse,"" absolutely. For another, I don't think it can be reversed. By reading this research you can have some advance notice of what is coming - more power to the rich - and plan a little. But that's about it. Third, I think, knowing this, the best focus is to consider how things like the Constitution can be safeguarded. This is a more modest goal than ""reversing their gains,"" let alone ""complete overthrow."" But I think it's achievable. As for the fracturing of their coalition: that's bad for them, but I don't see it as a very big deal honestly. This is the predictable result of a political party coming into power. It's like a stock that shot up $100 then fell $20 in the past few months. It looks bad in the 3 month view. But they're still up $80 from where they were at the last milestone, the previous election.

In Minnesota, there's the state employee retirement system (MSRS), the Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA), Teachers Retirement Association (TRA), St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association (SPTRFA), Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund (MERF), etc., etc. Each of these has a Board of Trustees (https://mnpera.org/board-trustees/board-members/) that have meetings that are (by law, in most states) open to the pubic (https://mnpera.org/about/board-trustees/) . Almost all of these have some money invested, via their asset managers, in companies that collaborate with ICE/DHS. For example, Vanguard and BlackRock are asset managers for many if not most public pension plans including MSRS (and TRA for BlackRock) and are the two largest holders of GEO Group (private prison operator) stock. Other examples: Palantir and Axon Enterprises (surveillance companies with ICE contracts) are like 40-50% institutionally owned. L3Harris (communications company with a large ICE contract), Dell, Comcast, General Dynamics (defense & aerospace) all have ICE/DHS contracts and all get public pension money via Vanguard and/or BlackRock. To re-iterate: Public pension Boards of Trustees (https://mnpera.org/board-trustees/board-members/) are typically required to have meetings that are open to the pubic (https://mnpera.org/about/board-trustees/) . The boards have fiduciary duties of course.

My depression and anxiety is absolutely through the roof, mostly due to stress over the threat of war with the fascist former US, and the witnessing of the sickening crimes against humanity that the Trump regime commits every day, but I have also been making a concerted effort to think and act more locally; focusing on supporting the boycott, and encouraging my less-plugged-in friends to not risk their lives or abdicate their consciences by crossing the border just to buy cheap shit in Buffalo, or whatever. Also, my mom died this year. It was almost merciful, because her Alzheimer's was progressing to a really heartbreaking place, but it still sucks. I'll be turning 40 this year, and it will be the first full year in which I have no living parents. I feel sad and old. On the good news front, the film/tv biz in Nova Scotia continues to be on the upswing, so my acting career has gone pretty well, for a covid-pivot. This year I got my third named credit and finally got invited into the ACTRA union. I also finally got around to forming the housing non-profit that I've been dreaming about for decades, and have made some progress in terms of getting all the regulatory hurdles cleared, in order to hopefully start building this year. It's my goal to get some quality dwellings built as quickly as possible, in part to be able to offer space to trans refugees and asylum seekers from the US who are fleeing the escalating nazi nightmare.

The horrors of the *gestures wildly everywhere* in the US are one very obvious reason. My local network of friends and family is down to almost nothing, due to people moving away or dying.

Work is becoming increasingly uncertain and the current state of the economy doesn’t give me warm fuzzies as our sector is particularly affected. It’s just been a tough year. It hasn’t been all bad, though. We like traveling and I’m an outdoors person, and we added three national parks to the list - Arches, Canyonlands and Joshua Tree. I hiked to the bottom of the Grand Canyon twice, once as an overnight hike, once as a four day backpack. Some of the photos are going up on the wall, I’ve gotten some of my best ever.

As mentioned above, one of my goals is to build community. Plus I’m looking at what road trips we can do with the trailer (we take the pups so we need the trailer for that) and what new backpacking trips I might be able to do.

That was great, but it also means two of my kids didn't make it. One I sort of understood - his family is poor but solid; they make it work, and he is an incredibly high achiever (tons of AP classes, multi-lingual, near-perfect SATs) who you'd figure is going to land a scholarship on his own. But the other was inexplicable, a young man whose family is just a wreck. They're chronically homeless, bouncing between motels, friends' couches, even a relative's garage. His dad is long gone, his mom can't hold a job, and he works 20-30 hours a week after school to support her and a younger sister, whom he has basically raised. And somehow he manages nearly straight A's. This kid didn't even blink. He said, I'll just apply to the colleges directly.  As did the high-achiever from the more stable family. The emotional resilience of these kids. I cautioned them that this is going to be a tough year, their dream schools are under scrutiny from the administration, forcing colleges to cut back on minority student admissions, they should be focusing on ""safety"" schools.... About two weeks ago they got the news. The high-achiever kid received a four-year full ride to his first choice, Harvard. And the other kid -- that valiant kid who has been dealing with so much and taking care of others his whole life -- also got a four-year full ride to his first choice, Columbia University.

I felt that 2025 was not so great, but reading all the other comments here, I have to acknowledge that I don't have much to really complain about. But I will, briefly: Biggest difficulty is having to monitor and manage things for my stubborn, physically-challenged elderly Mom who lives 2 hours away. The biggest challenge (and something that's on me to solve) is that The Problem Of Mom is on my mind 24/7, and it's robbed me of the ability to enjoy the present and to plan fun stuff. And about 50% of the challenge is warring with a sibling who hasn't been very helpful, and with whom I'm currently sort of estranged from as a result. Just what you need at Christmas... BUT.. some things to celebrate as well. Biggest is that in early December I persuaded same elderly Mom to accept a set of supports including a PSW twice a week, and a helper from a paid private home care agency. I'm hoping for a relationship to develop there, and that Mom will be happier and better supported in 2026. I owe the long-suffering Mrs C so much for her support and patience through this time. I did manage a moment of spontaneity when I took her to Montreal for a few days this fall  around her birthday. More such adventures owed. Other wins: we cleared all the remaining building permits from a long-ago renovation. We built a new toolshed. I put in more time on a bicycle: new thing- take commuter trains out to almost their end and bike around areas I've never visited before. And we remain so grateful for having several good friends. Besides health, they are the greatest assets we have. Hoping for a better 2026, for everyone",8 favorites,['/favorited/2/8797665'],2025-12-29 08:15:00,Monday

I feel guilty seeing all the people who have lost their job and are stressed about it, while I casually threw mine away, without being excessively worried because of savings. More survivor’s guilt piles on, because one of my current stresses is that I was pressured into starting job interviewing sooner than I planned to, and it’s feeling like I might land an offer a lot sooner than expected, to the point that I’d probably ask to push back the start date a couple of months. For fuck’s sake. I helped foster and rehome a bunch of adult cats and kittens this year, but I am feeling a bit overwhelmed now because placements are way down and I’ve got 5 fosters currently lingering. They are all happy here and I am able to care for all of them, but I have 6 cats of my own as well, and it is a source of stress. Feeding and scooping is not the main problem, it is giving all of the cats enough love every day. That takes time, and it’s getting to be an emotional drain.

There were a lot of stressful times, a lot of hard work, and a lot of frustrating moments. But overall, I’ve probably dealt with them all better than I ever have. So that’s something. Christmas turkey came out fabulous. It was also a comedy of errors. Turkey number 1 didn’t thaw in time, but Christmas Eve my MIL gave me another turkey (yay for her employer who gifts her turkeys… which she doesn’t use so gives to me) which I brined and brought to my mother’s to cook on Christmas Day. It was a hit. Finished thawing the other turkey in the fridge and made it up Boxing Day. Most of it will turn into turkey pot pie. Yesterday we had our monthly IRL Dungeons and Dragons game. One friend brought so many creative goodies. Dice boxes she finished and painted, Christmas crackers full of D&D jokes, she even brought wine and juice with fancy labels that were inspired by our campaign. I made schnitzel dinner for lunch. It was a fun day and we got everyone back on the road just as the ice storm was starting. Didn’t get much sleep last night because of said ice storm. In the field across from our place where the hydro lines run a bunch of trees must have fallen down because we were seeing the flashing and arcing (I initially thought it was lightning, but then it was funny colours and the noise was that spooky tesla coil type noise). This made the power flicker a whole bunch, and then we lost a phase. So the generator wouldn’t turn on consistently because there was still power, but all the battery backups were going berserk. So basically we had to shut everything down that could be damaged by a brownout. This was all in the wee hours of the morning. Finally it went out properly, generator kicked in, and we heard hydro trucks out on the road. Things were back on in good time. And now we have instructions on how to manually flip over to generator power in that situation if it happens again. We’re surprised and lucky nothing was blown. High winds today, which after an ice storm should be a disaster, but maybe the one in April cleared out enough brush that there’s not too much left to fall on the lines (and hydro was doing some preventative brushing in the area too). I have a pickled brisket in the slow cooker for tomorrow when my sibs in law are coming over for games.

In December of 2024, the pretty good job I had that I would have been happy to stay at for a while stopped paying me without notice. I knew business had dropped off since Covid & times were tough, but I was going to stick it out because it was the best crew I’d ever worked with. Ownership was obviously not forthcoming about the direness of the situation, though. After 2 missed paychecks, I took a job at a much larger shop I didn’t really want to work at because, you know, bills and stuff, so I started out 2025 with a new job that I was unsure about. I got promised that lots of positive changes were going to happen to improve technology and culture, and I was brought on partly to manage day to day operations, but also to help drive that change. I don’t know what anyone reading this knows about lean production and change management, but let me tell you reader, the employees had NO interest in any of it. All year long, I have been trying to implement procedures to streamline the place, and all year, I have been ignored and told no. Every little department wants me to fix the other departments. The wall between sales and production is made out of concrete. Finger-pointing and blame have been honed to a fine art at this place. The owner hasn’t really had my back. In fact, he has expressed some frustration with the lack of progress. So I have been working 50 hours a week in a stressful environment, trying to accomplish deadline-oriented work while pushing the same goddam rock up the hill every morning. By November, I’d had enough, did the math, (I can survive) and announced my decision to retire from the printing industry, effective 1 February, 2026. I feel like I’m hurtling towards a cliff and I don’t know if there’s rocks at the bottom or water. But I just cannot take it anymore. I’m too old to fight the sort of fight it would take to turn this place around and I sure as hell don’t need another failed shop on my record. Social Security will be about 1/3 of my current take-home pay, if I file, so I am looking for gig work or a part time job that doesn’t involve managing anyone. I hope, and am waiting for word, that I have some temp work with a friend who gets paid to build cave gates. It will be seasonal, but if it happens, would be a dream job- hard physical labor outdoors all day, doing something environmentally meaningful. But that hasn’t come through for sure yet and I go into the new year with slightly meager savings, and large tenterhooks. And for many other reasons, 2025 can fuck right off. Right as I was trying to stuff money in savings, the house needed about 25,000.00 in urgent repairs and appliance replacement… My burgeoning sleep disorder has grown real legs, and I’m navigating that with the care of a neurologist, new medications, and impossible-to-keep sleep hygiene routines. My dad’s health is slowly failing, and I’m trying to manage his care from 2000 miles away- I’m consumed with worry. 2026 has to be about beating that back. On the bright side, things 2025 brought me - a couple new basses, a solid spate of gigs supporting the new Coffee Sergeants album, one of which was at opening for Los Texmaniacs & Jimmie Vaughan at Gruene hall, pretty much the holy grail gig in Texas. We got 2 standing ovations at the Cactus Cafe the last 2 times we played there, ad I’ve had random heavies in the Austin music scene walking up to me after shows and telling me how much they loved my playing. I’ll take it. Played a wonderful show with Edith Frost in February, which led to an unexpected recording session playing bass on the new Bill Callahan album, and a new- to-me car. My 2002 Celica was really at the end of its rope, and I fount a 2015 4Runner that had been pre-dented for my convenience. It will come in handy getting to locations with the cave gating gig, and it has modern conveniences, like an engine and transmission that aren’t failing. One thing I learned from my old dog… live in the present, but never give up hope. Having hopes dashed can be grueling, but without it, what would there be? I miss that dog. /blog",12 favorites,['/favorited/2/8797707'],2025-12-29 10:39:00,Monday

I wish i had people who will listen to me and help me into better situation. I am autistic and have several health issues that have been getting worse because i cant take care of myself very well in the living situation i had been in from 2013 to May this year. I am almost totally dependent on my parents for food and supplies and helping me do much of anything because after years of isolation and deprivation i have very little confidence and motivation anymore. I moved this year from a place that i really loved (and miss now) that was not working out for me and was too far away for my family to visit and help easily, into a place that i did not like or want to be but my parents were very excited and happy about and they thought would be good for me and easier for them to visit and help me. I was willing to go along with their plans even though my gut reaction was telling me this was a mistake. If only my family would do what i ask of them instead of what they think is best for me, i would be so much better off physically and mentally, and it would have been less expensive and less work for them. Instead they pressure me into a place that is noisy and uncomfortable, where i still can't take care of myself and i can't pursue my hobbies and passions, and where i am still too isolated. They said they would be able to help me more in my new home and invest in improvements to the property but the investments and promised increase in help have not materialized. So now i am even more dependent on their unreliable help which is becoming even less reliable as they are nearly 80 years old. I am still so angry with them about the fact that a couple years ago they had a nearly perfect, much less expensive opportunity to provide me with a better life but they passed on it for what seemed like very selfish reasons to me",11 favorites,['/favorited/2/8797712'],2025-12-29 11:18:00,Monday

Condolences and sympathies to all of us who have been so affected; it's enough to make you believe in malevolent gods and spiteful, malignant astral influences. Or something. In 2025 the chaos at my job calmed down a lot, which was good, because the chaos at home was escalating rapidly. It's been rough. Bad decisions were made out of haste and fear and a real lack of available good decisions. I'm so tired. I'm tired of caring for other people and never having any space or time for myself. I'm tired of living in a house full of people.  I'm so burnt out by now that even if I do manage to scratch out a little time of my own I spend it playing Minecraft or scrolling aimlessly and it just makes me feel worse in the end. I feel martyred and unseen and also like I'm a horrible person for resenting the people I love. I also know that in the end, I volunteered for most of this shit, so I have no room to complain. But damn, when they said no good deed goes unpunished they were not kidding. I feel bad about complaining, because I am one of the lucky ones. I have a job and a house and I'm mostly healthy. Although not right now because I got a bad cold for Christmas and poof, there went the two weeks off that I was so looking forward to. I was going to get so much done, sigh. Caregiving is just wearing me down until there's nothing left. Every single damn day I have to take care of other people. I know it could be worse and I also know that it's probably going to get worse, which does not cheer me up. I am watching my brother slowly, slowly die and it's completely fucking horrible. It could take years yet while his brain slowly erodes to nothing at all. I don't know if it's worse when it speeds up or when it slows down. He's been much more lucid lately and actually, that makes it harder in many ways. I can't go on like this for year after year but I have a sinking feeling that I will. Meanwhile, my four year old granddaughter continues to really need me as her third, possibly most stable, parent. So, you know, there's an old man in the back room just staring at the ceiling and a little girl in the living room demanding too much screen time and the dog needs a walk and I just bounce back and forth, cooking three dinners so everyone is taken care of. I'm also poor AF again. It will be almost five weeks before I get paid and the cost of groceries at this point, on top of bad decisions, see above, is actually eating me alive. I had a couple of years being back in the middle class and it was pretty amazing, having some disposable income. Well, that's over. And I'm angry. I'm furious that the options that were available in the 20th century - reasonable pay for reasonable work, housing that costs a quarter of your income or less, not being followed forever by dumb mistakes you made in your twenties (I would never have gotten as far as I have if every apartment application demanded a background check and a credit check and on and on forever) - aren't available anymore for me or my children. I hate what this country and the world has become. I hate humanity, capitalism, the patriarchy, all the old trauma the Epstein stuff has stirred up for me and many others - solidarity, y'all, this too shall pass - but I wish I could stop hoping it all passes in fire, blood and death. I want vengeance, and that was never me before. I've lost my peace. I hold out no hope that 2026 will get any better. The best I can hope for here is to continue grimly holding on with my fingernails and hoping that at least some changes happen and that they are for the better and not the worse. Let us all hope for that",19 favorites,['/favorited/2/8797724'],2025-12-29 12:15:00,Monday

THE HIGH: A longtime friend started ghosting me in the middle of 2020.  I reached out a few times asking what was up, and got radio silence; I have sent holiday cards ever since to keep the door open but didn't press.  At about 3:30 today, he finally called me again.  He started with an apology (an overwhelming amount of life shit got in the way), and he was asking to be forgiven.  I welcomed him back, and we caught up some, and we ended with him thanking me for being understanding and promising to be ""back in the fold"" again. THE LOW: I checked my email after that call - and found an email from a company asking how I was going to pay for the damage I did to a car I rented a week ago.  ....""HuH?"" I said, ""I got insurance for that.""  I called the car company to ask what was up - and they said that their policy stated that I needed to have a police report submitted along with the claim.  ""But....there was no police report,"" I said.  ""It was a single-car driver-error fender-bender.  I was going to hit the brake when I was parking and accidentally hit the accelerator again and hit a fence.  Also, when we called the car company when it happened they said that the insurance would cover it, and we wouldn't need a police report."" The guy I was speaking with today said that in the rental agreement, it says I needed a police report.  If I didn't have a police report, they said, the insurance I got was null and void. I have reached out to my brother, though, who a) lives where the incident took place (and can maybe get an after-the-fact police report), and b) works in insurance and may have some ideas for how to navigate this.  I have checked whether the credit card I used has some automatic coverage - it used to, but does not any longer. I'm going to see what my brother says.

I gave up on (didn't get into any) musicals and had five parts with names and lines in plays! One in particular was absolutely amazing and I did well and people who saw me liked what they saw. So, awesome job on that front.  I will be taking a break for a few weeks to months, depending on what I find to audition for. I'm so worn out (see below) that for once I don't mind it and want to just get to vegetate after work rather than having to Fake Being Okay all night long. And my friends are awesome. Though one theater friend died this month, and a friend of mine just lost her husband finally last night. Sigh. That's sad in general, but also after he dies, she plans on giving up her rental home, getting a dog, and living in a motorhome roaming the national parks. An exciting plan, but also I will miss her. Work has been all over the place. I made probation, got told ""maybe this isn't the job for you, you just don't get it,"" followed by ""we'll work with you"" and finishing projects, to things getting unpleasantly weird the last few months. I hope things die down again after next month, but who knows. I have another twenty years of ""my career"" to drag through in which I hope I can stay employed and keep my head down and not get in trouble. I got a new volunteer job at a theater that is near bankrupt due to the treasurer, who we finally fired this fall. I hope we can...I don't know what, really, but we'll see there. There's been a lot of drama of the non-fun kind. I damaged my car...I'm afraid to do the math, but I drained 40% of my savings paying for my own shit, used insurance 3x, and almost all of it was my own damn stupid fault for fucking it up in petty stupid ways, like driving over curbs a lot.  I am going to need to get some kind of side hustle because I can't pay for my own stupidity any more :(  I don't know how to handle that. Love life: a few people got crushes on me, it was sadly not mutual. I am no longer friends with the ex-crush, which will bring delight to some. We are at ""pretend we don't see each other in public"" status and no longer have to interact in any mandatory capacity.  I did the ""eat grapes for luck in love"" thing at the start of the year,  nothing happened. God's plan for me is permanent singledom.  But given how much of a mess I am, that's probably why. Depression was going okay but sure does seem to be roaring back the last few months, between the dreary winter weather + work drama + general overload + car stuff.  I have gotten into ""I can't clean up my place"" territory and the car fuckups are concerning and I just feel stupid a lot of the time for various reasons.  I'm debating trying to get diagnosed again with WHAT WE CANNOT NAME IN PUBLIC, even if it's just to know for sure if I'm genuinely a mess for genetic reasons rather than just being inexplicably stupid all the time. I apparently can't take any of the meds for it anyway. So, it was a mixed bag year. Similar to 2020 in angst in some respects, but hey, at least I could leave the house without having a giant freakout about germs. As for politics, I have emotionally given up.

He was born somewhat prematurely, and weighed a mere 4 pounds at birth. He had one dead polycystic kidney and, while undergoing surgery, he coded and had to be revived. That’s when it was discovered that he also had multiple heart defects. So, at the tender age of barely one month, he underwent heart surgery to repair a crimped aorta. That surgery was like flipping a switch, and his condition greatly improved now that he had proper blood flow. But, then all attention had to be turned to saving his one good kidney, which was swollen due to its working overtime. There was also concern that his bladder was undergoing spasms. There appeared to be a problem with his kidney not emptying properly, but they weren’t exactly sure why. The doctors inserted a neph-tube to drain his kidney while they ran tests and did imaging over the course of a couple of months. It was determined the tube from the kidney to the bladder was crimped. Meanwhile, the daycare the baby was in decided they couldn’t take him as long as he had the neph-tube. They weren’t comfortable with the possibility of it somehow being pulled free. Since his parents both had to work, my wife decided to travel north and stay with them and care for the baby. That took up about a month of her time, in total. Luckily, her employer was totally cool with her working remotely. In late summer, the baby had surgery to repair the crimped kidney/bladder tube. It went really well, and just a day later, the docs decided to remove the neph-tube. At this time, the kidney has shrunk down to a more acceptable size, and the bladder spasms are being observed and treated with meds. Today, if you weren’t aware of all the drama, you’d think the little guy was just another happy baby. He turns one in January. (FWIW, the baby was born at Riley Hospital for Children (https://www.rileychildrens.org) in Indianapolis, and all of his subsequent surgeries and tests were performed there as well. The people there are pretty damned amazing and dedicated. For instance, the cardiac surgeon who performed the baby’s heart surgery had, just that week, performed his 200th infant heart transplant.)",20 favorites,"['https://www.rileychildrens.org', '/favorited/2/8797765']",2025-12-29 16:13:00,Monday

Really I need to stop following political news, and I try, but it is difficult to quit that habit.  It's the same resist shit from 2017 with a new coat of paint on it.  The party decided to not complete or release a 2024 post-mortem.  They won't be hitting 60 senators, they won't kill the filibuster, which means they won't be stacking the court to avoid 6-3 kills, and so really they're just a temporary reprieve until the next round of Republican rule.  For the people hoping to change the party from within you can look to AOC who carried water on A Foreign Policy Issue for the party at large during the election and was rewarded for this by getting shoved aside on Oversight in favor of a septuagenarian who promptly died of cancer.  Maybe we'll see matching outfits and silent auction signs again now that Hogg is outside the tent pissing in.  But I think 2026 is going to be the year they really figure out how to triangulate the US body politic again, by sacrificing trans rights.  Those 2-6 million people who stayed home and some fraction of the 30 million or so LGBTQ Americans?  Definitely yearning, eager, impatient even to vote for people coming in under the goddamn wire at their friends and family. I can't decide if they enjoy being this way or if their advisors and consultants, having tasted some portion of the $1.6B spent losing the popular vote for the first time in 20 years, are loathe to let go of that income stream.

(I'm still relatively okay, but oy my god the rollercoaster....) So - I am working on the whole rental car crash thing.  I'm filling out the crash report from Massachusetts, and had to get some info from the car company to fill it out; also I wanted to let my brother look it over.  I reached out to a woman named ""Niki"" who had first emailed me to discuss all of this.  Niki broke it to me that the insurance I purchased had a deductible, and no matter what I would be on the hook for that.  I told her what happened; she asked if we filed a police report, and I told her I had a Massachusetts Crash Vehicle report instead.  She wasn't familiar with that, but I sent her a copy for her to review.  She warned me, though, that the company I rented from tends not to tell people that they need a police report otherwise the thing is invalid, though; so if their insurance didn't accept it I would be on the hook for the full amount (estimate is $7K). That's a BIG amount. But what made it even worse was - everyone was telling me the deductible was $15 hundred.  However - somehow, in my head, I processed that as $15 THOUSAND.  So I was thinking I was going to be on the hook for the full amount NO MATTER WHAT.  I called my parents in a panic, but it was my father who finally got through to me (""wait a minute, your brother said it was only 15 hundred"").  And that was WAY better. I talked things over with my brother and called Niki again; she also had taken a closer look at the form and said that it should be what they need; in her experience, the kind of crash I had wouldn't be one that police would even show up to do a report ON.  And she also confided she's not the biggest fan of the company; and she's the one handling my claim.  So I just need to get this paperwork to her and that should be underway. But somewhere in there my brother also shared what his deductible was that I'd promised to pay...he's comfortable with my doing it in installments starting when I get another permanent job, and I've estimated a budget for that and should be fine. So I went from ""yay I'll be fine"" to ""OH CRAP I'M FACING MASSIVE DEBT"" to ""oh no wait it's debt but it won't be THAT bad"" in the space of about an hour and GOOD GOD can things please EQUALIZE already",6 favorites,['/favorited/2/8797917'],2025-12-30 09:49:00,Tuesday

It contained a nice suitcase style guitar case with velvet lining. He loved it. While he was admiring the case and also talking about how he couldn't wait to order the guitar and for it to get here... my spouse snuck off and came back with... the guitar.

I live alone, luckily on the ground floor but I can't go out by myself other than to sit in a chair by the back door, when the weather allows. - I hate being dependent on other people. - I can't do most of the things I love - hiking in the forest, wandering round the city taking photos of interesting neighbourhoods, solitary trips to see weird films at the Prince Charles Cinema, nipping out to the supermarket for that forgotten ingredient. - I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard. Everything takes so much energy, both mental and physical. I have to think about every single movement before I make it. - There are small joys - my cat, my friends (who have been amazing), good neighbours. My employers are very supportive.

Deep hopes and energies to them for a different, kinder, year ahead. Trying to write a 2025 personal summary has been surprisingly difficult. It should be easy, as I've kept a diary this year ending (no idea why I did that, but very glad I did). But this year has been complicated and messy and sometimes contradictory. And above all, the most personally intense one since 2009 (my mom died, this unleashed a load of inheritance and legal issues, I had some adventures and misadventures in the USA and Canada). The winter and spring gone were not good. Several friends, and several cats, passed away before their time. One cat in particular was a hard blow, as was one person in particular, the friend I'd known longest, going back to primary school days. And former colleagues, close and distant, through the year. Because of the nature of a few of my academic jobs in the 1990s I ended up with a very large network of sorts - but it's now the mid 2020s, and the inevitable is happening. And celebrities I grew up watching on TV and in movies too; maybe it's just me but there seems to have been an unusually frequent passing away of these people this last few months. Health is complicated, but deep in my 50s means its increasingly do the exercise, take the vaccines, don't eat cake with *every* meal, and the rest is luck. It's taken a few knocks, but I'm also better - or less negligent - of taking care of myself. Again, the diary has helped, as some kind of reminder. Life direction is (finally) much clearer now, at least in terms of subject domains. It's taken far too long, to many years,  to get to this point, but I'm sort of there. I also completed another course - Introduction to Ecology: Understanding the Biodiversity Crisis - which, along with three recent courses - Introduction to Assessment and Management of Chemicals, Planetary Boundaries, and Energy Transition (fossil fuels to renewables) - helped this focusing. And I applied and somehow got onto a postgraduate course in Ecology at Oxford University, despite enduring the most difficult interview of my life. Several personal projects - collecting all transcripts going back to school days, collecting copies of every paper written - are nearly complete. Outside has involved more walks, more orchards, and some study of mistletoe. Inside has involved a lot of reading around the aforementioned academic disciplines, and some planning on writing (very recently deciding on Ghost over Substack as a new platform of choice). I guess friends has been the big positive in 2025. For different reasons, several good people from the past are unexpectedly back in my life, threatening my semi-hermit status but in a good way. I've finally met several other people I've known online for a long time. My core long-term group of close friends are all good. MetaFilter continues to annoy (2 parts), inform (3 parts) and entertain (5 parts); in this age of the online, those are good metrics. This year coming I'm looking seriously at trips to meet other people in Canada, Germany and Denmark, and Sweden and Norway are always there, reminding me to return. I'd also like to visit several good and close friends in the USA, but ... it's the USA. So that's very much on hold for now. Hopefully a few meetups in Canada can be arranged. Macro/World stuff is complicated. Others upthread have mentioned the largely negative politics. Climate and biodiversity are also, well, not good. I hang out online with a collection or networks of actuaries, climate specialists, glaciologists, and various scientists, and things are ... not good at all. Not all bad - the under-reported acceleration in solar power is a massive positive. Highly related to that; England has been relatively lucky (though it largely doesn't realise it) with its own climate for the last three years. At some point, very likely in years not decades, that luck will run out. And whether the ""Big Heat"" happens before or after the next general election will be hmmm influential. There's a lot more, but that will do else it'll end up being book length. Oh speaking of which, a long-term friend recently proposed a book idea to me which scratches many itches. I'm inclined to give it a serious shot. Will see. Wishing y'all an interesting (but in good ways), fulfilling, and unexpectedly rewarding, 2026",15 favorites,['/favorited/2/8798150'],2025-12-30 23:55:00,Tuesday

Partly because of the holidays, partly because of the whole car crash admin - but also partly because I think I was just tired, and being low-key seemed more important.  A lot of the museums I was thinking I'd go to were in Manhattan and a little small, and I realized that I have half days on Fridays and it makes more sense to just hit them up after work on a Friday than to spend an hour on the subway getting to a museum I'd probably only spend 45 minutes at. I have started to make some small changes to maybe get a little bit of oomph back.  Earlier this morning I spent an hour doing some research and note-making for the whole NYC Restaurant Bucket List (https://ask.metafilter.com/388421/A-DIY-Food-Eating-Bucket-List) thing I want to do in the coming year, including updating an existing ""List of places Anthony Bourdain ate at"" - and discovering that one such spot is like 3 blocks from the market I was already planning to hit up tomorrow.  And after that - I did my usual Youtube Binge while eating breakfast, but then turned off the TV and read for an hour; I am seeing a movie this afternoon (the first Friday of every month BAM gives members free popcorn with their movies), and I'll do more reading when I come back. Am trying to think of more ways to be more analog in the new year on top of other things - I wanted to explore more restaurants, but also more movies, museums, and other Stuff here in the city.  I think finding a copy of a book about NYC public art (https://shop.nypl.org/products/art-hiding-in-new-york) in someone's ""free books"" box on their stoop yesterday was a sign from the universe that I'm on the right track (also in the box was a map of some good ramen spots in the city).

One of the lovely Rickessa's strengths is her ability and willingness to move, to do stuff while I am strong on sitting there, hearing the music to the end or waiting until the church bells finish their peal before I budge.  We can both be a bit too good for our own good at what we are good at! So when Christmas Day was done and the last plate was scrubbed and put away, Rickessa was ready for what's next, making plans for 2026, wanting to sort this and that and make a start on the other. This time, Mr Sit Still Don't Move The Year is not Yet Over Let Us Leave 2026 to 2026 prevailed. It was bliss for both of us. Dec 26th we luxuriated in what we have, each other, a splendid roof over our heads, central heating, a glorious sense that the family is doing pretty well by and large. It was glorious. That's official, La Rickessa said so herself. First thing on New Years Day, we got bad news. DIL's brother had died of a heart attack overnight. It's a cruel blow for DIL who lost her Mother in truly tragic circumstances only 6 months ago. And yes, we soon learnt that dear daughter in law was shaken to the core, ""I just want to hug my Mum and talk to her"" she gasped thru her tears. In a way, his death was expected. Now 52, he was diagnosed as schizophrenic in his early 20s, ( a condition triggered in his case seemingly by heavy use of skunk - something he never stopped), has been sectioned many times after going missing for months on end and being found by police wandering and confused miles from home, sometimes in other countries, and has previously been told by his voices that it is time to say goodbye. My son was calm and strong, ""Dad, it is a cruel blow and it has massively triggered my wife who is raw and missing her Mum terribly but it could have been much worse. He died doing the things he enjoyed, cigarettes, alcohol and KFC."" After we'd spoken, I took a deep breath and asked myself, run around or sit still, return to centre or let the emotions sweep thru me and carry me away? Then said, Ok son, we're here, whatever you and DIL need from us just ask. We'll be there for you (we're in different countries). It took an hour or two but me and Rickessa talked, she-""shall I book flights for tomorrow?"" me-""no, we'll sit still, they will let us know what and when. Our job is to get back to where we were. We can be sad without being derailed. We can care and help without shredding either our plans or ourselves."" I got some lovely smiles and we held each other very close that night. It's Saturday now, unofficially the last weekend of our 2025, 2026 has been postponed until Monday Jan 5th. We'll be on a plane to the UK soon enough but right now, we're at peace, I'm typing to you, Rickessa is munching her muesli, the church bells are silent, and there is a carpet of snow on the banks of the canal outside in this beautiful old 17/18th century Dutch town of ours, adopted but home.

Do we doubt that each of us encounters reality not directly, but through the thicket of our individual psychic realities, with their stubborn frames and secret desires, the vast sediment of our past histories? So I want to keep reading this, but tripped over these two questions.  I think the answers are probably the opposite of what is implied by them.  We must doubt there is some unconscious world hidden from us, the secret driver of all things.  To the extent that an unconsciousness exists, we've got to throw out any sense that it is a homunculus, that it's a discrete thing .  It is no more an entity than it is a selection of computer programs, or whatever other analogy we want to throw at it.  Our problem with the unconscious is related to our problem with consciousness, in that we are constantly deluded that we understand it, because being conscious is predicated on having the sensation that we're understanding it. For the same reason, while we can doubt we encounter reality directly, it's not because there are hidden psychic realities and secret desires.  There are no secret desires in the sense of there being something you want, that you are not allowed to confess to yourself.  That just...isn't a thing.  You are a desire-machine and your mind stays extremely well-acquainted with your shifting desires. I love Freud as much as the next person but we have to bracket him--and the entire psychoanalytic project--off, away from current thinking.  It's a historical curiosity but it has led to nothing but confusion when taken seriously as a science--or, even if not a science, as a field with explanatory potential.

Over the last year or so, I have gotten fairly well acquainted with Freud, both in terms of history and in terms of contemporary work. This is all because I fell in love with Patrick Blanchfield (https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/people/patrick-blanchfield/) 's Twitter feed, back in the day that such a thing mattered. He's pretty smart and I like his work (sample essay here (https://late-light.com/issues/issue-1/death-drive-nation) ). Then I discovered that he has a podcast (https://ordinaryunhappiness.buzzsprout.com/) that is perfectly suited for my boring job. Since then I have read a couple of Janet Malcolm books (which are super fun reads and very accessible), picked up an essay here or there, and just in general have started thinking about the world a little differently. Freud was a bit of a mess, but there are a few things he absolutely nailed. For example, transference is one of the most complicated, not intuitive, powerful psychological forces we live with every day, and it takes a little bit of work to get your head around it. However, there are other things that clearly don't stand up. The Freudian axiom that to have a fantasy of a thing is equivalent to doing the thing is clearly immensely limited (to say nothing of ethically problematic at best), although I think there is more applicability of that idea in early childhood states, which is something that is difficult to think about as more or less rational adults. And the fact is that we would do well to consider how important our childhood experiences are in terms of our daily lived reality as adults, especially because it is difficult to tease out exactly how that works and why. Freud was absolutely correct in pointing at that, although I think it is essential to see his work in a post-Kleinian sense, moving away from the Oedipal fixation and to a more general sense of the constellation of relationships in a child's life and how those go on to pattern and shape their adult reality. There are no secret desires in the sense of there being something you want, that you are not allowed to confess to yourself. That just...isn't a thing. You are a desire-machine and your mind stays extremely well-acquainted with your shifting desires. mittens, with respect, I think this is a perspective that reveals the privilege of living in fairly liberated times. I guarantee you that there are people coming from a more repressed cultural reality, or family background (either historically or in contemporary times) who very much have and continue to repress certain desires. In general, times have changed a lot since Freud wrote, in significant part because some of the understandings he promoted have moved into common understanding. Strangely, this changes the character of lived experience vis a vis his theories. There are updates and continued work that are very important. But overall, I have become convinced that Freud is one of the formative geniuses of the times we live in -- which is strange, because I really didn't think that, even a few years ago",5 favorites,"['https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/people/patrick-blanchfield/', 'https://late-light.com/issues/issue-1/death-drive-nation', 'https://ordinaryunhappiness.buzzsprout.com/', '/favorited/2/8795224']",2025-12-19 11:58:00,Friday

I guarantee you that there are people coming from a more repressed cultural reality, or family background (either historically or in contemporary times) who very much have and continue to repress certain desires. Oh, I think it's very much the opposite.  Our liberated times have the benefit of making desires legible (different than conscious/knowable), although at the occasional cost of petrifying them into diagnostic or social categories, denying them their inherently malleable nature.  It's hard to think of a desire that can be expressed today, that wasn't expressed--perhaps more cautiously, although not always--a hundred or a thousand years ago.  But all of this takes place in consciousness.  The idea of a hidden unconscious desire is a fiction--a great fiction that has inspired an enormous amount of thinking and art, but also a lot of pain. And I think we need to be careful with repression.  Yes, absolutely, if you have a desire your culture frowns on, you repress it in the sense that you keep it quiet.  But you know what it is, that is, it is not unconscious, it is revealed to you, at least in part, because otherwise you wouldn't know it was forbidden.  It is sometimes difficult and painful to keep it quiet, to attempt to put it out of mind, to forget it. But Freud takes it further and says we substitute something for the desire.  ""The neurotic creates substitutive satisfactions for himself in his symptoms, and these either cause him suffering in themselves or become sources of suffering for him by raising difficulties in his relations with his environment and the society he belongs to.""  But the difficulty was already raised by the society, and anyway while desire may be malleable, it isn't easily switched to a new target in that way.  It puts an intolerable burden on the patient, who is seen to have generated his own mental illness.  I don't want to simply say Freud is victim-blaming; I know there is a lot of work around his changing views on his patients' reports of trauma.  But his view of repression does place a lot of responsibility for a patient's symptoms on the patient himself rather than the painful environment.

Maybe they should just put ""no genocides"" in the rules for the sake of transparency. Does Israel serving as the only long-standing non-geographically European country (or ex-colony in the case of Australia) lend credence to the point Israel is a European derived settler-colonial system?

https://www.metafilter.com/211406/Disharmony-at-Eurovision,LSK,https://www.metafilter.com/user/70238,"Eurovision has had a structural issue with its voting for a while now. Even before October 7 and its aftermath, Ukraine won the 2022 contest on the basis of outsized public voting in the wake of Russia's invasion. I don't begrudge that, but it's clear Israel exploited that in 2024 and 2025, by sending sympathy ballads and running ad campaigns encouraging people who didn't even watch the contest to vote for their song. Azerbaijan also figured out this structural issue, and won in 2011 in part through a campaign that distributed mobile phones in smaller countries (where influencing the public vote would be easier) and had them vote for Azerbaijan. I think the last two years show that Eurovision cannot guarantee a fair contest under the current rule set, and the most frustrating facet of that is that Eurovision released updated rules that tilt in the direction of addressing these issues but don't actually solve the problem. The voting changes amount to: - Changes to jury composition - People doing public voting get a maximum of 10 votes instead of 20 - Countries are discouraged from disproportionate voting campaigns But these rules don't change the weight of the audience vote (still 50/50), and they don't impose sanctions on countries for carrying out voting campaigns. So the structural issue still remains. Personally, I think the contest has been long overdue for a scoring overhaul, and this would have been a good year to experiment more aggressively. Maybe that means limiting public vote to pre-selected fans; maybe it means limiting it to the people physically in the arena. Maybe the public picks the top 5 acts and the jury picks the winner. (And... maybe it means that countries that can't safely host because they're engaged in war only get to enter as exhibition acts and don't participate in the voting?)",2 favorites,['/favorited/2/8792801'],2025-12-12 10:25:00,Friday

This act establishes a four-factor test for circumstance where expropriation may happen without compensation: (a) where the land is being held for market value rather than active usage (b) where a government is not using the land and had acquired it for no consideration; (c) where it is judged that the owner has abandoned the land; (d) where the market value is less or equivalent to the present value of direct state investment. Obviously, there's room for some judicial abuse.

At first I fancied that line might be a way of distinguishing South Africa from Zimbabwe. Farm productivity in Zimbabwe collapsed when the government seized white-owned farms (not because only whites can farm, but because authoritarian governments are uniformly incompetent). But this is unlikely because South Africa recognizes a debt of gratitude towards Zimbabwe for support during the struggle against apartheid. Then I thought maybe the line was a sideswipe against domestic opponents. Firebrand opposition politicians like Julius Malema want immediate and thorough land redistribution. Maybe this diplomatic note was an opportunity to score domestic political points. Instead, South Africa was refuting a vile lie calculated to sow distrust, hatred and violence.

As delfin points out, that's not a very winning message when the other guy is making (wild, overblown, clearly infeasible to you or me but maybe not to a person who's not paying much attention) promises. I can see the thought process of ""well maybe Trump won't do all those things he says but at least he's going to try."" Harris seemed to want to position herself as the next leg of a relay race begun by Biden while failing to recognize that a lot of people didn't really think Biden had run a particularly great race. I have a pet theory that part of the reason for that is that after 4 years of Trump we returned to a state of not having the WH start a 4 alarm fire every other news cycle and we all relaxed a bit. Maybe part of the reason Biden's messaging was so tepid was that we all had News PTSD from the previous 4 years and dialed down the intensity of our scrutiny of the activities of the administration",4 favorites,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin', '/favorited/2/8788133']",2025-11-25 21:24:00,Tuesday

While I think in general terms 27% sounds about right, what's missing from this theory is that everyone is part of the 27% about something.  So, yes, there is a portion of any population that is generally unhinged, but very few are totally unhinged about everything.  I believe, based on clear and unequivocal facts that I just pulled out of my arse, that every single person has at least one thing they're completely bonkers about and cannot, will not, be talked around.  The article touches lightly on this. The problem comes where a politician identifies a number of things that a sufficient people are unhinged about and builds a platform out of them.  That's what Trump did and continues to do.  Politicians who appeal to these people are not interested in actually governing and often have little or no policy knowledge; they just have to speak the magic words to the 27% and that's enough to get them elected and get access to all the grift.  The 27% is not constant, as the article points out, but there are enough things that enough people refuse to understand that all the aspiring dictator needs to do is figure out the right combination of wacky theories and they're in.

I don't think Republicans or MAGA are as united as people think, and I think the Trump personality cult is papering over a lot of the cracks. Once Trump is gone, you'll see the various factions fighting for power. Old factions: Evangelicals have been around essentially forever, and in their current political alignment at least since the 1970s. The slaveocracy class in the Deep South has been there for centuries. The super-rich as an interest group have a history that might go back to the beginnings of the country as well. Libertarians go back decades, they're still in the mix at the moment, I don't see them surviving a brutal fight at the top. New factions: the ""Dark Enlightenment"" types (the 'secretive donor circle' link about touches on these, think of Peter Thiel as a primary subject) don't have a lot of voters in their corner, but they do have monetary backing, and with Vance as a probable collaborator they have a seat at the inner table, and might inherit the presidency if Trump dies soon, so they're a threat. Other groups like explicit white supremacists and groypers probably won't survive unless they attach themselves to a larger faction. Remains to be seen if some sort of consistent MAGA-populist ideology will spring from the post-Trump rank and file in the party. There's no guarantee that such a faction fight would have a good outcome, the winning faction could be a more distilled version of the current evils that we're witnessing, just with more focus on their specific concerns.

The South was largely competitive, Democrats were winning at a lot of different levels in the South in all of these years. Gavin Wright has a paper showing that it's really the passage of NAFTA that completely kills the Democratic Party in the South and ends this kind of biracial coalition that existed from the passage of the Voting Rights Act in '65 up until the early '90s. IMO this is again incorrect, or at least extremely incomplete. I know I tie everything to housing, but guess what also started really kicking in the late 1990s? Home prices in California, Massachusetts, and NY started really diverging away from the US median due to downzonings done in the 1970s, and the mass exodus of displaced people towards the south. Lots of them were probably pissed at northern policies that pushed them away from their homes, and voted accordingly, swamping the marginal victories Democrats were winning in those southern states. CA (Regan & Nixon, both from CA) used to be far more balanced than they are now, just like TX was (Ann Richards in the 1990s was governor.) Yes, prices shifted in the 1990 - 2000s, where a home in TX, WV, KS, or CA cost pretty much the same, with very minor locational differences. That is no longer true. Largely Democratic states, since 1990: CA 9m growth MA: 1m NY: 2m Illinois: ~1.5m Washington and Colorado are really the biggest Dem pickups. The entire NE has seen extremely marginal population growth in the past 40 years. Current Republican states, since 1990: FL - 9m, matching CA TX: 14m NC: 4m Arizona and Nevada are fast growers that are still basically swing states. What's worse is the heavily Democratic states barely seemed to notice or care, and it's gotten sort of severe, but the next Census it's about to hit the fan. If you believe the majority of the people displaced from the north are Democrats and going to swing those states, well history says you are incorrect.

This question could read two ways: How is it that Trump became the standard bearer, or how specifically did Trump's style and rhetoric unlock people's internal permission structures and let their bigotry fly in public. To both of those questions, I will refer to the absolutely imperative book Mindf*ck , by Chris Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower. The text does require a little bit of reading between the lines -- it is a summation of testimony he gave to the joint leaders of Congress in a secure facility after the 2016 election about what he had witnessed, and was clearly written with the help of counsel saying what he could and couldn't say. That being said, the outlines of both of those answers are in that book. The very short answer is that even now, 10 years later, we still have not really begun to deal with the intentional weaponization of social media. Bannon and Miller are outright Nazis, and they are the ones calling a lot of the plays on a tactical level. In 2015, Bannon had made contact and earned the confidence of what may have been a group of older billionaires, but specifically in the context of that book, definitely Sheldon Adelson. Adelson has wanted a ""Second Constitutional Convention"" for years (and I guarantee you they are still working toward that basic plan). Bannon was empowered to contract Cambridge Analytica, a company that did a lot of dirty work for MI6 in the developing world on behalf of global capital, engineering failed states so that oil companies or mining companies or whoever could come in and take over. Cambridge Analytica was paid with Adelson's money to scrape all of Facebook and utilize the power of algorithms for political persuasion. Clearly this entails a lot of what we're talking about here: increasing resentment, giving permission and validation for racism and other forms of bigotry. As Wylie explicitly spells out multiple times, what was being done was the intentional fracturing of the polity of the United States with time-tested techniques aimed at creating a failed state. I'm not 100% sure of this, but I would wager that the selection of Trump as a standard bearer was always a part of the deal. It has become clear that Miller in particular is a student of Nazism, and models his strategy off of them. I suspect that Miller and Bannon coming to work for Trump was a matter of them choosing him, and not the other way around. I would love to know if there are any books or reporting that cover the early days of their association. I'm getting long, this is no longer the ""short answer,"" but that story is a key to a big part of it. However, that said, this whole thing is, to a very real extent, overdetermined. There were just so many factors at multiple levels of society, that all were working in the same direction. If you just do this: Reagan repeals fairness doctrine, 1981 --> Clinton signs NAFTA, 1993, deregulates media/telecom industries, 1996 --> Obama declines to prosecute anyone from Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, 2008/9 ...you're most of the way to the problems we have, even without whatever twist of fate brought Bannon together with Adelson. But to really get your head around that shorthand timeline, and a huge, systemic mess, is the generations-long (plural! generations -long) self-defenestration, loss of direction and awareness, and whatever else you want to call it that's been going on in the Democratic Party. A huge number of Trump voters key on feelings of resentment and betrayal. Well, who abandoned and betrayed them? It's a doozy of a problem how obvious that answer is, and yet how intractable. And also also, we haven't even mentioned the Powell Memo, which certainly underlaid many of the things we're talking about. This is why I call it overdetermined. There were just so many things all pushing the same direction, with so much money and power, connectedness and organization. I don't despair. I also think that a (probably very violent) factional struggle among stakeholders on the right will happen, is probably unavoidable. But I'm not exactly optimistic, either. At the very least, we need to find some cracks in the technological-totalitarian state that is forming, and I don't think we have the faintest clue how to go about that, much less the kind of social cohesion that would be needed to do so. Considering that ""all our base are belong to them"" in terms of where and how social cohesion happens in this benighted age, our prospects are slim indeed",12 favorites,['/favorited/2/8786736'],2025-11-21 11:25:00,Friday

With the newly passed districts, it will be 7/8 R/D or 87.5%.  So roughly a +28% for Reps over the percentage of the electorate. However: The new map is under fire from several directions, including a number of lawsuits AND work collecting signatures for an initiative petition. (Interestingly, any law passed by the legislature can become the subject of an initiative petition if a certain number of signatures are gathered in a certain way in a certain number of House Districts.  I've never seen this happen before, but it is happening now! If they can gather the signatures, it will come to a vote most likely in November 2026 - August 2026 is also possible.  Either way, the maps won't go into effect into 2028 at earliest and most likely, never.) Between the lawsuits & the petition drive, there is a high likelihood that the new maps will never go into effect here. And an even higher likelihood that, even if they do go into effect, it won't be until 2028. FWIW a lot of the local Republicans are bemoaning the fact that they let themselves be pushed around by Trump.

Article I, Section 4, Clause 1: The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. Since then Congress has said states must put roughly equal numbers of citizens in each Congressional district, that you can't disenfranchised people based on race, stuff like that. But the core assumption has always been that the states were in charge of elections and districts within that state. That's why gerrymandering is still a thing that can happen. I think that's largely BS but with Trump in the Oval Office I'm revising my opinion a tad. He CANNOT end early voting, or mail in voting, extended voting hours, or all the other vote suppression things he wants to do because it's a state matter.

There can be problem with this sort of blind redistricting especially like in the US where one party has concentrated membership and one is diverse (for example blue votes in cities). Take the simplest case: square state, single city in the centre, four districts, red voters outnumber blue voters. The shortest boundary length is four squares. This puts 25% of blue party voters in each district and 25% of red voters in each district. But because red voters outnumber blue voters they take all four districts. Even if the voter split is 50.1%-49.9%. Obviously this is a very spherical chicken example but it is a problem any time one parties voters are concentrated and the other more evenly dispersed where the dispersed party is in the majority. The boundaries are likely to split the minority party between multiple districts. One of the fundamental problems that exasperates gerrymandering is number of seats hasn't kept up with population growth (https://www.coopercenter.org/research/congressional-representation-keeping-pace-population-growth) .  Also because the minimum district size is a whole state it defacto enables land in Montana and Wyoming to vote.

It required an independent commission to draw the maps and for the state legislature to pick one to make law. The legislature took this to mean they could draw their own map and pass it instead, completely ignoring the committee. Voter groups sued, the case sat at the Utah Supreme Court forever to rule on the issue of standing before the merits of the case could be argued. Finally it came back that yes, voters do have standing to sue over their maps, so it went to court. The judge told the legislature to re-draw the maps in a prop 4 compliant manner, to which the state legislature called itself into session, passed a law changing how prop 4 determines fairness, and then passed a still gerrymandered map meeting these new fairness requirements. The judge saw this for what it was and threw out their map, instead mandating the state instead use a map submitted by the plaintiffs as well as putting an injunction on the law creating new rules. So now we have that new map with a D+11 district which will be used for the 2026 election, and a fuming supermajority legislature running a statewide ballot initiative to altogether repeal prop 4 as well as threatening the judge with impeachment.

Thus the weird situation where Texas is stopped from using its map because it is drawn along racial lines to split up the hispanic vote, while in Louisiana Black residents are fighting to keep a map that was gerrymaned to give the Black residents a rep.

On top of the missing colleagues and students, the building that housed my office has been demolished. One day, without warning, workmen showed up to raze the Uplands Preserve, bayfront parkland where I liked to commune with raccoons, snakes, and osprey. Why? So that the school could put up beach volleyball courts. Distraught neighbors, many of whom used to Preserve to walk their dogs or to witness the awe-inspiring sunsets over Sarasota Bay, organized a memorial service for the many trees displaced by what the school had done... Alas, the ugliness of this world proved too great; my New College found itself—in Leibniz’s terms— “incompossible” with Florida. In the end, I do recognize that the school was not just the victim of De Santis’s authoritarian educational program. New College’s utopian ambitions were also out of step with a world that treats education as an expensive commodity, and for which the humanities are increasingly an afterthought. But what really made the place the best of all possible liberal arts colleges was the trust it placed in students, its recognition that “in the last analysis, every student is responsible for his or her own education.” It gave to all of us who knew and loved it reason to believe that “the natural state of the human spirit is ecstatic wonder.” We should settle for nothing less. grantimatter (https://bsky.app/profile/grantimatter.bsky.social/post/3m5fuc5ew422z) : ""This is a very good read about what #NewCollegeOfFlorida was really like, and what forces were and are arrayed against it.

Andrew Johnson's Department of Education was signed into law in 1867, after the Civil War, and it had nothing to do with delivering education as HearHere mistakenly implies, but was instituted to collect statistics. But we're talking about higher education, and more specifically about public higher education in its post-Morrill Act form at land grant universities, and the 1862 Morrill Act was itself very much a phenomenon of the Civil War and the fact that the South had practically no effective representation in Congress, for what ought to be historically obvious reasons.

https://www.metafilter.com/210803/Cis-women-are-enjoying-man-sized-levels-of-testosterone,Well I never,https://www.metafilter.com/user/318139,"My long-distance girlfriend of many years and I are now both cis women, both  60, both menopausal, both experiencing post-menopausal reduction in sex drive, to nearly nothing, in my case. We are people for whom sex has been a big and vitally important parts of our lives, and, although I am otherwise single (no primary partner) she has a primary partner and sex is a big part of their life. My girlfriend has been taking T. It's really important to her to maintain the sexual part of her life, and of her relationship with her primary partner, and it's going well for them. I have not tried T. I haven't done well with past hormone interventions, for instance during the extraordinarily protracted and bloody periods of perimenopause, and after a disastrous effort at trying a Mirena IUD to get them under control, my gyno scheduled a uterine ablation and said to me, ""You can never take hormones again."" I don't know whether I'd have the same problem with T that I did with estrogen and progesterone, but I haven't felt moved to try. It's weird, my lack of interest in sex, even by myself. It's an every-so-often thing, and requires some kind of outside stimulus, like reading a book with a lot of the kind of sex that revs my engine. Or used to. I was an early masturbator and sexually precocious as a child and pre-teen. I've had a lot of lovers, a lot of sex. It has always mattered to me a lot as a way to connect with people, to experience something transcendent, to feel completely in and good about my whole body. But I've let it go very easily and don't necessarily want to do the work to maybe get it back. Maybe if I had a local partner I'd make more effect. But even saying that, I think it's not true. Fortunately, my girlfriend is OK with this. I've been there when other poly queer friends were dealing with one partner losing her sex drive post-menopausally. They'd been together for decades, but I remember one of them saying to me, ""I'm not sure we can even still be lovers."" And that seemed sad to me. My girlfriend and I had a great conversation this summer in which she said that she will always feel like my girlfriend, and that doesn't depend on sex, and I said, ""That's great, because for some reason it means a lot to me to be able to say 'my girlfriend, J' and not 'my friend, J.'"" There was kissing. There was wistfulness, a little, on my part. But no sex that time. I've been the best friend or lover of a surprising number of men during their transitions, and seen the changes in them: the muscles that appear as if from nowhere, the new body hair, the voice changes. The increased energy, in some cases. My 18yo son is trans; fortunately, he got to do a blockers-then-T puberty so he never developed breasts or had a period, for which he is very grateful, though his scheduled hysto ovo has been cancelled because the hospital where it was going to be has stopped doing gender treatments for under-19s, and this has been hard for him psychologically. He's afraid that by the time he turns 19 next August, there will be new restrictions and he won't be able to get what he needs. Testosterone is a powerful thing. And I honor the individual choices of any person who decides to use it. But I could also write a whole theoretical thing about ""Why is it so often that women embrace things that make them more like men? What happened to the second-wave feminist dream that men might become more like women?""",18 favorites,['/favorited/2/8778365'],2025-10-23 15:43:00,Thursday

Trans men have been known to have their POTS, hypermobility, and chronic pain improve after taking T. I suspect outside the general effects, a lot of women are getting effective treatment for undiagnosed or poorly treated underlying health issues. The improvements in POTS and hypermobility could both be due to a general effect of the problem too much testosterone causes women who haven’t stopped ovulating yet: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, in which a layer of tough collagen which the eggs cannot break through is deposited around the ovaries (a much tougher layer of collagen than that is characteristic of testes), and when the woman ovulates, it forms a cyst on the surface of the ovary. Hypermobility is an effect of collagen associated with joints being too stretchy, and POTS can be an effect of collagen around blood vessels being too stretchy. Oddly enough, hypermobility can be a feature of menopause (https://jeanniedibon.com/navigating-menopause-with-hypermobility-and-ehlers-danlos-syndrome/#:~:text=Hormones%20definitely%20affect%20hypermobility.,peri%2Dmenstrual%2C%20and%20menopause.) : Hormones definitely affect hypermobility.

Very difficult to find information about the effect of testosterone on anxiety and depression in AFAB people, even though apparently it can help for those conditions. I kind of hate that this kind of story might make people hate on menopausal cis women for ""having it easy"" in relation to trans people when it comes to getting hormones. This is a false conflict. Cis women very often struggle to get hormone replacement therapy of any kind, or get doctors to take their pain and discomfort seriously, especially if it's linked to menopause, because patriarchy. I would also encourage people to think a bit more about the complexity of hormones and gender and sex.

And so this article is more than a little rage-inducing for me.  Ironic.  After all, I am thrilled that all women are getting exposed to the idea that hormone treatments can be a part of addressing imbalances in our lives.  Not for everyone, to be sure - but there has been such a lack of research, acceptance in the medical community, and awareness in the public that it is a good thing - it must be. Yet the plight of trans people in the US in access to hormone treatment is so dire that at the same time, having the transphobic New York Times be the one publishing this - and spouting its usual ""centrist"" lines like ""Enthusiasm for testosterone cuts across political lines."" is...not so great. My own experience?  Post-op, it took me a good 6-9 months to learn how to orgasm again.  After that, things were fairly smooth sailing for a few years - and then I hit a wall - absolute anorgasma.  In tears and miserable, I went to my gender-affirming-care primary doc.  And they recommended a pill used for post-menopausal cis women that has a combination of a little E, and some T.  It worked.  Really well.  I did some research, and realized that this is an issue post-op trans women often experience - a few years after surgery, we can end up with zero to very, very low T levels (well below cis-normative for women), leading to serious sexual dysfunction.  So I've been evangelizing ever since. All of this in an environment in which the T levels of trans women is considered to be an item of public record for athletics, access to public spaces, incarceration, and more.  With the reality that if post-op, we're often at near-zero-T - and if we're non-op, we have a doctor literally watching our T levels to keep them generally well below what many cis women can obtain with their own biology. Infuriating is one word that comes to mind.  Our T levels are not your business. So, soap box time:  Women, not just trans women:  This stuff is real.  It is really an option.  T gel is working great for me now that I'm in the EU and can't get those pills.  Just the tiniest amount (my levels are still lower than almost all cis normative levels for women) and I'm fine.  This is one more tool to address inequalities forced upon us by the patriarchy. And NYT:  You can go crawling back to the sewer where you emerged from on this issue.  We can find some other source to bring this to the attention of more women",23 favorites,['/favorited/2/8778680'],2025-10-24 13:14:00,Friday

Land-based lithium mining is currently still cheaper than seawater concentration. And by the time we hit limits on our ability to get lithium from existing mines that are a tiny fraction of those we've long deemed acceptable for mining fossil fuels, there will be more than enough lithium embodied in batteries reaching the end of their service lives to cover the requirements for making new ones. The lithium issue is real, but frequently overblown. Whenever I see reference made to it, I will try to find out what the same writer has ever had to say on the topic of the damage being done by fossil fuel mining, which to my mind is the only reasonable basis for comparison.

Modularity is an advantage that solar really has going for it. Flyvbjerg & collaborators have gathered a database of large projects and actual project outcomes including cost and schedule overruns vs the estimated cost from when the decision was made to invest and proceed with the project.

This is because solar and batteries are still going down in price per watt. Most projects increase in price and have cost overruns because of raw materials going up the more people dither on building something. Solar is unique in that panels have been dropping in price since their inception. That's not going to last forever. Eventually the price will be constrained by raw material costs. Then there's the question of the next day. How long do solar panels last? How long do batteries last? What are the costs of making and recycling them? It depends on the panel and the cell. They don't break so much as degrade. So by year 25 a good panel is still outputting 85% of its rated capacity. I would not be surprised to see some installations still putting out decent amounts of power after 50 years. Aluminium frames and glass are infinitely recyclable. Silicon cells are a little bit harder because there's all sorts of shit on the cells these days and also copper mixed in for current collectors. Utility scale batteries are engineered to provide many more cycles than a consumer battery. With a consumer battery the key metrics are gravimetric and volumetric density. The layers are wound or compressed tight together. Dendrites only have to travel a short distance and can quickly lower the capacity if not managed carefully. Utility scale batteries on the other hand by and large favor LFP chemisty. Utility LFP batteries look a lot more like a car battery stack. There's more space, less dendrite growth, but awful gravimetric density. A phone battery has 250-300Wh/kg. Utility scale is 90-150Wh/kg. But utility scale battery storage has space in spades. Recycling? Relatively trivial. The thing that keeps it down is that iron and phosphates are not really worth anything. NMC chemistry is ramping up recycling. It's estimated that half of batteries make it back for the minerals to be recovered. LFP just needs the right incentives. And for the industry to come together to make standard form factor for batteries which will make it much easier on recyclers to automate thus driving down the price of recycling. Things are on a pretty good path right now",33 favorites,['/favorited/2/8772548'],2025-10-05 05:43:00,Sunday

Data point of one, but the newest and onlyest nuclear project in 40 years in the US, Plant Vogtle, went about $20Bn over budget on an original $14Bn estimate. About $10Bn came out of Georgia’s consumers through rate increases. The project also has accrued $10Bn in loan guarantees from the federal government. So far they’ve managed to avoid default even through Westinghouse’s bankruptcy in 2017, so theoretically they haven’t cost the public anything. But they’ll eventually have to be paid back, either through the Georgia consumer by increased electrical costs or by some form of loan forgiveness at the cost of the US tax payer. On these large infrastructure projects, the company almost never loses. Even if they go bankrupt trying to complete the project, their debts end up discharged, and municipal governments are always willing to let electrical companies hike rates to recoup any costs.

When the last edition of Cadillac Desert came out, something like 25% of California's power generation was being used to pump water. Solar-powered farming is digging Pakistan into a water catastrophe (https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/solar-powered-farming-is-digging-pakistan-into-water-catastrophe-2025-10-02/) [ ungated (https://archive.ph/ge0ZJ) ] - ""As Pakistan undergoes a solar revolution (https://archive.ph/IWnrw) , farmers like Ali are increasingly ditching diesel and grid power for sun-powered tube wells, according to interviews with 10 growers, as well as government officials and analysts. The solar boom has coincided with the rapid depletion of water tables in Pakistan's most populous province, according to previously unreported Punjab water authority documents viewed by Reuters."" Solar-powered tube wells drive increased irrigation, expanding fields of thirsty rice crops Development coincides with rapidly depleting water tables in Pakistan's bread basket Farmers financially benefit from cheap Chinese-made modules despite environmental concerns Officials studying impact and trying to prevent further depletion There are no recent official estimates on the number of tube wells in Pakistan, which doesn't require their registration. But so widespread is their use that farmers choosing to power the devices with solar are set to drive a 45% collapse in the amount of grid electricity consumed by the agriculture sector in the three years through 2025, said energy economist Ammar Habib, who serves as an advisor to Pakistan's power minister. His estimate was based on consumption data published by the national energy authority. Reuters' calculations based on Habib's data, which were reviewed by Habib and Lahore-based renewables analyst Syed Faizan Ali Shah, indicate that some 400,000 tube wells that once relied on grid electricity have switched to solar. Farmers using solar panels have likely purchased an additional 250,000 tube wells since 2023, Habib estimates, signalling that the sun now powers roughly 650,000 such devices across Pakistan. Details about the scale of Pakistani agriculture's transition to solar and its impact on groundwater are being reported for the first time. The solar boom in Pakistan, which was encouraged by a sharp increase in power tariffs in 2023, is being replicated worldwide. Heavy production of solar panels in China has driven an 80% collapse in prices of the modules since 2017, prompting farmers from lushly forested Brazil to drought-prone Iraq to turn to the sun to power their irrigation systems. The explosion in availability of cheap solar panels is posing a particular threat to water levels in the South Asian bread basket of Punjab. The water table has shrunk below 60 feet - a level designated as critical by the provincial irrigation department - across 6.6% of Punjab as of 2024, according to maps published for internal use by water authorities and seen by Reuters. That marks an increase of some 25% between 2020 and 2024, while the deepest pockets - with water levels beyond 80 feet - more than doubled in size during the same period. [...] The switch to solar has allowed 61-year-old Mohammad Naseem to save some 2 million rupees (about $7,000) - or more than quadruple Pakistan's gross domestic product per capita - in power costs since he bought his panels four years ago. The ability to irrigate at will has increased production modestly by between 400 and 600 kg of rice each year, he said, though the quality of the crop yield has improved, allowing Naseem to obtain better prices. ""I wash it with water. I sleep near it,"" said Naseem, who prizes his panels so much that he dismantles them every evening and brings them home from the fields to prevent possible theft. ""Solar panels should be installed at all costs,"" said 38-year-old subsistence farmer Rai Abdul Ghafoor, who has been saving for a purchase. While poorer farmers like Ghafoor are still reliant on diesel and grid power, many agriculture-dependent villages have pooled sums to purchase the panels as communal property. Haji Allah Rakha, an 80-year-old farmer who has 16 panels, shares them with two other families. ""They contribute, and we all benefit,"" he said. ""Farmers share, rent and move panels like tractors,"" said Lahore-based solar-panel merchant Shahab Qureshi. ""They sell land, jewellery, or take loans just to get it. Within five to six months, your return on investment is fulfilled."" RAISE THE GROUNDWATER Federal and provincial officials have started to pay more attention to the slow-boiling crisis, especially after India suspended its participation in an accord governing the sharing of water from the critical Indus river system (https://archive.ph/rJJZL) [ 1 (https://www.metafilter.com/210144/weaponizing-water) , 2 (https://www.metafilter.com/188052/Ringfencing-the-Roof-of-the-Worlds-Waters) ] earlier this year. Punjab began aquifer-recharge pilots, which aim to slow depletion and ensure stable groundwater supply, at more than 40 sites before India's April move, though officials said such projects have grown in importance since. ""This is our small effort to return the due share to the aquifer,"" said Adnan Hassan, a researcher for Punjab's irrigation department. ""If polluted water is injected (due to over-extraction), the next generation will suffer."" The province is also reviving old infrastructure such as the Ravi Siphon, a colonial-era tunnel that helps stabilize flows from the Ravi River. Officials hope that improving conventional irrigation methods will reduce the need for farmers to extract groundwater. Independent environmental scientist Imran Saqib Khalid said Pakistan still lacks measures like the comprehensive mapping of wells and real-time monitoring of withdrawals that would contain the water crisis. The solar push lacks ""any method to the madness,"" he said, adding that without a change in governance, groundwater depletion would continue unabated: ""In the long run, this will have an impact on cropping intensities and the types of crops we can grow, which in turn will impact our food security."" also btw...

What is more, solar-desalination enables us to produce enough freshwater to irrigate billions of acres of degraded and desertified land, enough to restore them to thriving forests and create a carbon sink of sufficient scale to offset all or most of human CO2 emissions.""[ 3 (https://www.metafilter.com/192606/data-rule-everything-around-me) , 4 (https://archive.ph/o9Z8K) ]",6 favorites,"['https://www.metafilter.com/210570/Golden-State-as-a-guide-What-if-electricity-becomes-too-cheap-to-meter#8772562', 'https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/solar-powered-farming-is-digging-pakistan-into-water-catastrophe-2025-10-02/', 'https://archive.ph/ge0ZJ', 'https://archive.ph/IWnrw', 'https://archive.ph/rJJZL', 'https://www.metafilter.com/210144/weaponizing-water', 'https://www.metafilter.com/188052/Ringfencing-the-Roof-of-the-Worlds-Waters', 'https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1392052766256766980.html', 'https://www.metafilter.com/192606/data-rule-everything-around-me', 'https://archive.ph/o9Z8K', '/favorited/2/8772626']",2025-10-05 13:01:00,Sunday

It's morning down here in Victoria, Australia, and 35% of my electricity is coming from wind, 4% from solar ... and 61% from brown coal. Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM) links electricity grids across all states and territories excluding WA & NT.  Over the last 12 months, the NEM fuel mix (https://www.aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem/data-dashboard-nem) was 45% black coal, 16% brown coal, 5% gas, 7% hydro, 9% solar, 17% wind.  A couple of our smaller states are largely powered by renewables: SA (61% wind 8% solar 28% gas) & TAS (77% hydro 21% wind 2% gas). Our three most populous states all participate in the NEM but still heavily rely on coal: NSW (68% black coal), QLD (72% black coal), VIC (61% brown coal). Australia has a lot of work ahead to decarbonise. Net Zero Australia (https://www.netzeroaustralia.net.au/publications/) 's modelling of decarbonisation pathways found that cost minimising plans used large amounts of utility scale solar firmed by batteries and gas, with limited expansion of wind capacity, with solar projected to be more competitive. Hitting net zero domestic emissions by 2050 or 2065 assumes that capacity of new infrastructure can be built at a rate of 10% / yr or 5% / yr respectively, significantly higher than historical rates. The scenarios of decarbonisation by 2050 and 2065 are aligned with limiting warming to 2-2.5 degrees C and 3 degrees C respectively -- i guess the modelling assumption is that all countries cooperate with equivalent decarbonisation schedules. Electricity generation could be decarbonised faster than transport and industry, but transport and industry are major sources of domestic emissions. There's still an assumption of reliance on large scale carbon sequestration and storage to provide negative emissions to offset emissions from sectors such as aviation that cannot be decarbonised. One piece of the puzzle not addressed by the above decarbonisation study was exports. Australia exports significant amounts of coal and LNG, accounting for around 7% of Australia's GDP (weighting by value, not by carbon emissions)",2 favorites,"['https://www.aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem/data-dashboard-nem', 'https://www.netzeroaustralia.net.au/publications/', '/favorited/2/8772668']",2025-10-05 16:31:00,Sunday

I am concerned about the downsides of unmetered energy, because a certain contingent is very quick to forget that electricity is a means to an end for most, not an end of itself.

In the Q&A, he's asked about a contentious quote from his book and I thought his response was worth hearing in its entirety: Audience Member: In class, we were discussing your book Between The World And Me, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwsfteDVK9M&t=1857s) specifically your experiences observing 9/11. We came across a quote that seemed contentious. I was just wondering if you could explain it to me. On Page 87, you said: ""I could see no difference between the officer who killed Prince Jones and the police who died or the firefighters who died [in 9/11]. They were not human to me— black, white, or whatever. They were menaces of nature."" Thank you so much, sir. Ta-Nehisi Coates: Prince Jones was a gentleman I met at Howard University, which obviously occupies a big part of Between The World And Me. I'm not going to presume you've read the book. When you're an author, you presume nobody reads the book. Prince Jones was a gentleman who I met at Howard University. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful human being. Smart. Intelligent. Was a product of a mother who was born into a sharecropper family in Opelousas, Louisiana and raised herself up. Gone to LSU, went into the air force and become a radiologist. She pulled, literally pulled herself from the lowest classes of American up into the upper echelon of America and her pride and joy was her son— also her daughter too— but her son Prince Jones, who was this beautiful intelligent human being who I came across at Howrard University. Prince was killed in 2000. It was September 2000. My own son was a month old at the time. He was on his way to visit his fiance and his then-year-old daugher. The office who killed Prince Jones was supposed to be working on narcotics. He was dressed in undercover attire. He had been enrolled into another affair and was looking for someone else. He had not bothered to change his attire. He saw Prince in his mother's jeep. [Pauses.] As you can tell, these emotions are not completely gone for me. He ran the plates. The jeep came up for his mother who lived in Philadelphia at that point. This was not enough. He and another office followed Prince Jones from the suburbs of Maryland through Washington, D.C. out into Virginia, and shot and killed Prince Jones. This was before the era of Black Lives Matter. There were no videos or anything like that. We don't really know what happened. I watched over the next few months as the state of Virginia investigated not the officer but investigated my friend Prince Jones. They were sure he had to be a drug deal or something. They looked at every angle, interviewed all his friends, looked at every aspect of his life. The officer was not only not charged; he wasn't even disciplined publicly at all. Nothing happened. He went right back to work. This was in the middle of the time where the police department he worked for had countless cases against him. You have to understand what that does to you. How that makes you feel about your country and your relationship to your country. Police are the representatives of your country. They're charge with the most harrowing responsibility possible. They have the ability to take your life. I understand we need police officers to do that. We need police if we're gonna have a law-abiding society. But there's absolutely no accountability. That's built on all the other decades of no accountability when you're Black in this country. That's built on all the times that, at that point in my life, I had been stopped myself and not ended up shot or assaulted, but had been stopped for reasons that I knew not to be legitimate. No, I had no sympathy at all for anybody at that point because I felt so strongly that the country had no sympathy for my friend Prince Jones who was dead in the ground. No sympathy at all for his daughter who was going to grow up without a father. I just— I didn't have it. Time passes. You grow, get a little wise. You understand your anger is not good for anybody. You understand that your inability to perceive people as human beings represents the fact that you yourself have somehow been stripped of something. That in allowing Prince to die that way, the legacy only to be the anger, which I admit I still feel today. Only to be the anger. My ability to dehumanize other people. If I allow that, I've somehow lost something. So I don't feel that same way today. I definitely don't. But Between The World And Me is a work of literature. Its job is more than anything to capture the feeling and I felt that way at that time. I was cold, man. I was absolutely, absolutely cold.

They always work from a position where the Good and Just is assumed as a starting place, and no input can ever call that into question. The idiot (and I really think that is the correct way to see him) literally argues for sympathy for Charlie Kirk -- says he ""did politics the right way."" This regarding a person who would see polite, centrist, upper middle class Jewish people like himself completely disenfranchised and reduced to second class citizens at best . He is the epitome of Robert Frost's dictum that ""A liberal is a man too broad-minded to take his own side in a quarrel."" It is sadly funny in gentler times.

That racism is rampant not just on the right and center but among many who consider themselves left-of-center. That opportunity in America is largely the result of happenstance. That collective action is needed to have a chance at any of the things he took for granted, and will always need rebuilding, and support, and continued growth if we want to preserve the democracy he claims to love. In interviews he regularly hides his questions and comments in lengthy, self-focused and big word sentences that run on forever. For minutes, even. In articles, he not so slyly has always tried to be this ""I'm liberal but I am actually centrist and gosh darn it, I could really make a lot more money if I appealed just a little bit to a few conservatives.""

The thing I loved most about this podcast was that it was two moral people with moral points of view, still ending up in conflict. What the Democratic Party has done over the last 10 years has fundamentally not worked. Women have measurably fewer rights. People of color are measurably in more danger. Gay people. Trans people. Poor people. Fundamentally every group that Democrats purport to serve are worse off than at the end of Obama’s tenure. There’s an old aphorism that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting results. That’s why Klein appears to feel lost. The strategy of Democracy in recent decades feels like a slow march to the right on fiscal issues while trying to right all social ills and somehow we’ve ended up with a country racing to the right. It’s exhausting to see the right “swallowing frogs” and yanking this country into terrifying territory and then seeing the left doubling down on strategies that do not work. The response seem to be even more stridently seeking ideological purity and I’m more of my traditionally liberal friends spouting right-leaning political views because the left kicks out anyone who doesn’t check every single box. Like Klein, I have the privilege of being a cis het white male, upper middle class to boot. I’m fine no matter what happens. And that privilege sounds horrifically insensitive to anyone whose right and lives are in danger. And like Klein, I’m lost. It’s not working. I worry about my wife and my kids (one who is bi and went to an in-state school instead of Georgia Tech because holy crap that’s no longer a safe place for queer people). We’re a party filled with people who want the best for another and claim to take the long view on things, yet refuse to trade pieces for the future advantage. The long view = strategy. How do we accomplish a brighter future over a series of incremental steps, that sometime even appear to be regressive, because the long-term results are worth it. Try playing chess where every move has to be aggressive, where you can only take pieces and never lose pieces. That is a failed way to play chess and as we’re seeing in our failing state, a failed way to play politics. When Mefites look at people like Klein (and me) and think “those guys are awful”, I feel lost. I feel despair for our future. It’s what, more than anything, causes advocates and allies to give up. I love my children unconditionally. They can say horrible things about me and I’ll still keep coming back to get punched in the face. I love my wife nearly unconditionally, but even she could, in theory, with enough effort, drive me away. I don’t feel that way about anyone else. If you want to denegrate folks for questioning how we can find a path back to safety for all these targeted groups, I don’t know what to say. I don’t have unlimited and unconditional love to give.

The Democrats are hostile to the left, and have been forever, but especially over the last 20-30 years. The reason the Democrats fail is because they, like Klein, refuse to see the fight they are in for what it is. For example, I saw someone on Bluesky last night post ""Trump didn't send the National Guard to cities to ""fight crime,"" he sent them to cities to normalize unconstitutional use of the military against civilians."" See how easy that is? And yet, where are Democrats? Missing. In. Action. Democrats have been drifting right my entire life, and people like Klein are there, are put in the positions they have by powerful institutions like The New York Times, precisely to give cover to Democrats to move to the right.

Consider Klein and Derek Thompson's much ballyhood book on ""Abundance."" Their central premise is that business regulation and zoning requirements are stifling adaptive economic growth, in particular with regard to affordable housing, environmentally sound development and functional infrastructure. What they're doing here is taking a left of center wish list and saying the way to accomplish it is by deregulation , which is of course, what Republicans and big business want to do. What they don't talk about at all is the way that the regulatory state in the US has been almost entirely dictated by big business to stifle competition from smaller, independent operators. To be clear, there's even a term for this, ""regulatory capture,"" which so called smart guys like this should know. They don't talk about it at all. They also don't talk about the ways that wealthy interests, accumulated capital and the media that they own and control argue against and obstruct at every turn things like affordable housing or green development. It's disingenuousness all the way down. They turn a blind eye to the obvious and well documented reality, and instead suggest that the problem lies with the accomplishments of the liberal left, which is the extent that regulations do restrict the action of capital. This is either blind idiocy, rank hypocrisy or nihilistic careerism. It does not really matter which it is, because the results are the same and the approach is absolutely consistent over time. To close the circle here with regard to the Democratic Party, this book has been absolutely championed by Barack Obama, calling it the ""book of the year."" Bringing it back to the OP, here, the reason that people are spicy about this is that Ta-Nahesi Coates does what many of us have wanted to see for many years, which is that he brings Klein right to a place where all of these contradictions and elisions of history are spelled out, only with regard to race and violence in the United States, and Ezra Klein just.... ignores it.

Because the regulation that we now have has been so captured (as mentioned above) by big business, we are effectively moving back towards the Gilded Age where terms are dictated by those large, mega corporations to their own benefit. The Regulations exist, but are twisted. The reason why regulation has not been removed completely, but instead has been a project of big business to capture, neuter and control, is because there is still a degree of memory the American people have from the destructive forces that required constraint realized in the aftermath of the Great Depression. I would argue that even the environmental destruction of the 60's and 70's that ushered in sensible Clean Air and Clean Water legislation is very fresh in people's minds, and even those who are ""conservative"" understand that Big Business ends up fucking the little guys, and our world, without monitoring. I don't think Smedly is saying we need to remove regulations. I believe (though would need confirmation) the viewpoint is this: Regulation no longer serves the greater good fully, it has been carnival mirrored into serving multinational corporations who know they haven't been able to fully remove those regulations without people from both parties rising up against their representatives. But now, with their capture of Congress and the Supreme Court, they are viewing Project 2025 initiatives as the pathway to do just that.

The man has professed time and again what his beliefs are / what his desired end state is and as far as I can tell he is 100% on board with women's rights, trans rights, equal rights for people of color... all the things. We all aspire for the same world. And yet, here's a list of things said about him ON THIS THREAD: * unable to finish a sentence * like he’s really really lost and doesn’t know it * too old to be as he is * discount Daniel Denvir * tell you why I hate him : he's wrong in a dangerous way, pretty constantly. * a little to the left, but only in harmless ways that don't upset people * Yglesias-class galaxy brain Let's be clear -- this is how you speak about someone who professes over and over and over an explicit desire to elevate marginalized groups. He doesn't say ""I only want trans people to have some rights"" and he doesn't say ""I only want women to have some rights."" And yet you ""hate"" him. You fucking hate people who want the same thing that you do, and questions if we're on the best path to getting there when the last 10 years have been a dumpster fire for the those marginalized groups. Again, this is how you speak about people who want the same things that you do, but they don't do it well enough. You HATE them. No offense, but that's gross. And it's a sure-fire way to ensure that 10 years there are far fewer people fighting for the cause than there are today. The polls show that a large swath of independents have been voting Right and if you think it's because they suddenly changed their ideologies, I don't buy the assertion. Maybe it's because they have been told over and over that they are not wanted, they are not appreciated, they are not good people. Lorddogbotherer asked if I wanted an apology. What a weird thing to ask. I don't want an apology, but it would great to not be despised because I question if the current path is the best way to get you all the rights you deserve. I have no doubt that the things you say about me are worse when I'm not around. To use your same rhetorical flourish, am I supposed to thank you for that? We are shrinking the tent.

Well, I can't imagine ever voting for MAGA, I'd slit my wrists first, but I also don't need to fucking vote. And then you all on The Blue can argue about me like you do about the folks who didn't vote for Kamala because she didn't take a hard enough stand on Palestine. Y'all love arguing about that one.

She has a concept that I keep thinking about: she calls it The Antisocial State. It is related, I think, to Ruthie Gilmore's ideas of the Antistate State and organized abandonment. In a nutshell, the Antisocial State is a form of government that no longer sees itself as obligated to protect citizens from precarity yet retains (and expands) every mechanism for monitoring, disciplining, and extracting from them. It pretends to cut spending but in effect shifts it from the social wage to subsidies for private asset appreciation. It abandons low-wage and non-waged populations to fend for themselves, though it never releases them from its grasp. They remain tethered to the state as permanent debtors. It creates superfluous populations (people who are not useful to capital) and deals with the surplus by incarcerating or deporting them. In its extreme form, it represents the complete fusion of neoliberalism with authoritarianism. It maintains the infrastructure and state power of governance not to secure collective well-being (let alone flourishing) but to guarantee the conditions for private wealth accumulation, all while controlling and disciplining labor and populations that the system renders economically superfluous (or threatening). Sound familiar? And look, the same logic applies at a global level. Palestinians the ultimate example of a population rendered economically superfluous, their existence an inconvenient problem for the system, and their genocide and permanent destruction an acceptable solution to the Western powers that be. I don't hate Klein, but his vision of politics is sorely inadequate to meet the current moment. When Klein says that he doesn't know what to do, its because he believes the system wants to work for the people it has already restructured itself to abandon.

This myth is directly addressed in the OP essay: As I mentioned in last week’s Tuesday post, Klein had recently recommended the Democrats run pro-life candidates in Missouri, Ohio, and Kansas, having apparently forgotten that voters from those exact states had embraced abortion-rights referendums. The issue came up again in the conversation with Coates, but Klein seemed to stick to it, as if the concept behind his suggestion was more important than the context in which it would be applied. Klein also addressed how successful attempts to vilify trans people have been, acknowledging his fears over the ways Republicans will make this an issue in coming elections. To be clear, he isn’t just worried about the political cost of backing trans people but also the additional grievous harm that will be inflicted on trans people if Trump-supporting politicians continue to win. I’m using these examples because these are the ones that Klein mentioned as areas in which he felt that people on the left should, perhaps, compromise in selecting politicians or accepting policies that they don’t really want. That Klein is stuck on these examples shows how deeply he is lodged inside the framing that the Republicans have put forward. When you’re scared you get tunnel vision. If everything’s malleable, potential or imaginary future harms start to seem equivalent to concrete harm, even violence, being inflicted today. You start to equate things that aren’t equal.

(https://newrepublic.com/article/201104/ezra-klein-charlie-kirk-politics-compromise-strategy) It actually covers similar ground as above in regards to Klein's tunnel vision: But what is Klein’s explanation for why people are choosing MAGA over Democrats? He argues that Democrats have “stopped doing politics.” That’s an inoffensive enough claim, but the problem is that Klein’s understanding of “doing politics” focuses—not entirely, but certainly overwhelmingly—on compromise. He valorizes the idea of “political coalition-building, building across these gigantic differences, building across public opinion—both not just as you wish it existed, but as it exists.” But the primary examples he has offered in recent interviews for what it would mean for Democrats to “do politics” and build broader coalitions—running more pro-life Democrats in red states and accepting MAGA’s basic framing of Charlie Kirk’s life and legacy—all involve ceding ground to the right. And this demonstrates a poor analytic grasp of political reality and of what is necessary to build a truly majoritarian Democratic coalition [...] What’s particularly frustrating about Klein’s refusal to engage squarely with these ideas—he’s made a couple references to Democrats “trying more things,” including economic populism, but these have always been offhand—is that it has to be intentional. I mean, this is the main debate happening right now in the Democratic Party, between populists who want Democrats to focus on fighting oligarchy, and moderates like Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer who are hunting for AIPAC-approved candidates they can invite to Napa wine caves for crypto roundtables with the DSCC. (I know that sounds like an unfair caricature of the other side of this debate; tragically it is not.) Even conservative analysts, like Patrick Ruffini, whom Klein invited on his show to explain how he predicted the 2024 election, recently argued that “the best chance for Dems to win the Senate is to nominate some DSA-lite ultra-populist for president who scrambles the coalitions enough for Dems to win Ohio.” Klein’s blinders on this topic lead him to make analytic mistakes in his diagnosis of the Democratic Party’s problems. For example, speaking with Coates, he described “the huge backlash to Bernie Sanders for going on Joe Rogan’s show because Rogan was transphobic” as a prime example of “a politics of content moderation that took hold that was about enforcing boundaries of what were and were not ideas we should be engaged with.” While that incident certainly inculpated some of these dynamics, the backlash to Rogan’s 2020 endorsement of Sanders—which was led and exploited by Sanders’s opponents—should be understood in large part as a story of a Democratic establishment cynically weaponizing identity politics to stop a Sanders-led populist takeover of the party, a tactic Democratic elites have utilized frequently to protect themselves",15 favorites,"['https://newrepublic.com/article/201104/ezra-klein-charlie-kirk-politics-compromise-strategy', '/favorited/2/8772206']",2025-10-03 15:28:00,Friday

It does seem like the Democratic party leadership has given up on changing minds, they want to cling to votes. Republicans are very good at grabbing the mic and telling us all what to talk about and then we are all arguing on their terms. Whereas the politicians that are exciting right now are refusing those terms - like Talarico in Texas who knows how to stay on message and point out - trans people aren't jacking up your insurance premiums, immigrants aren't inflating grocery prices and black people aren't keeping your pay low. You found the wrong culprit. I think Klein finds it kind of icky to keep arguing about trans stuff for example because what you find out is that the loud Republicans (the ones he talks to, who are famous and have their own shows etc) actually will go on record with their hate. Like, it feels bad to try to bring someone over and politely argue, if someone says their pronouns are they/them, can't we just be nice to them? and find out their answer is a full throated NO. So let's just not have the conversation, let the hate simmer and talk about zoning. I personally think it's much more powerful as well as righteous to clearly say, I don't have a problem with trans people in any way and we both know the reason you keep talking about them is because your policy is unpopular swill which is for the rich only.

You can make a very good career of it at places like The New York Times, where I spent 15 years, and win lots of prizes. I don't think that's journalism. These people are absolutely amoral and cynical. They will get up and lie and know they're lying. And the reporters in the room know they're lying. It's a dirty little game. I never did that kind of reporting. I was always in the field. I never reported on Washington. I never followed around the secretary of state or something.

It's at the beginning. Coates explains his critique was of Klein's praise for Kirk: “the presentation of him as, and I don't want to misquote you here, but as basically a paragon of politics and how politics should be done... And then after doing the research, I had to be honest with you. That's when it got really, really difficult. When I went past my initial impressions and started going through all of the clips of the things he said, the way he talked about people, the way he described groups in ways that honestly, even as I was writing it, I was uncomfortable saying. And so the idea that this guy should be in any way celebrated for how he conducted politics. The fact that he just slurred across the board, you know, all sorts of groups of people. And then ran an organization, which appeared to me just a haven of hatred.” Klein gives a really bullshit response that doesn't address this at all: “I don't know, for me the immediate hours after somebody is murdered in public, when you see that sort of grief and horror pouring out of the people who loved him and many people loved him, my instinct then is to just sit with them and their grief. Right? To say, I can for this moment find some way to grieve with you, to see your friend the way, or in some version of the way you saw him. Right? That's not my view of the person's whole legacy.” He doesn't explain why he misrepresented and praised Kirk's work. Then he claims what he did say is not the whole picture, like he is trying to take credit for critiques he didn't make, or invalidate Coates for calling out what he did say, because there was secretly something more. Klein is a talker more than a thinker. And his shtick can only work when people are deferential to him. Coates could have easily called him out for his non-response, but he didn't. It is somewhat problematic that Klein is in a position where he can spout his nonsense drivel and a lot of people take it seriously",16 favorites,['/favorited/2/8772322'],2025-10-04 05:22:00,Saturday

I was just listening to the latest Citations Needed episode, ""Sociopathic 'You Got to Hand It To 'Em' Punditry and the Rise of Politics as Sports,"" (https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/ep-229-sociopathic-you-got-to-hand-it-to-em-punditry-and-the-rise-of-politics-as-sport) where they make interesting arguments about which political actors and projects the Beltway consensus pundit class allows to be decontextualized and admired in the abstract. They give the example of Fareed Zakaria praising Netanyahu for ""handling remarkably well"" the reshaping of the Middle East since the start of the Gaza genocide. A genocide Zakaria asks us to ""set aside for a moment” so we can praise and admire Netanyahu being a winner.  Why would we do this? Why would we give any props to someone if the end result of what they’re doing is genocide?! Similarly, Ezra Klein asks us to momentarily set aside all the awful things Charlie Kirk has done and said and what he's fighting for, so we can admire Kirk's ability to ""do politics the right way."" It's morally outrageous and insane! Why would we do this? Why would we give props to someone if the end result of what they’re doing is, ultimately (because we all know where this ends), genocide?! The Citations Needed folks also make an excellent point about how this same abstracted, decontextualized ""you gotta hand it to them"" approach is immediately recognized as morally bankrupt and offensive when the shoe is on the other foot. They cite the example of Columbia professor Joseph Massad (a young Bari Weiss' target for cancellation during her college years) being hounded by Weiss and other major media outlets as Massad used a similar decontextualized, clinical stance that could be read as “handing it to” Hamas for their execution of the 10/7 terrorist attacks. They also cite Bill Maher's cancellation due to his similar ""gotta hand it to 'em"" remarks about the 9/11 terrorists. So clearly the elite pundit class can recognize how offensive the ""you gotta hand it to 'em! They're just practicing politics the right way!"" decontextualized stance is. But they only seem to understand it when it's used against people they think matter. People they see as fully human like themselves. I think this is why people ""hate"" (disagree with??)

https://www.metafilter.com/210549/Ta-Nehisi-Coates-and-Ezra-Klein-Hash-Out-Their-Charlie-Kirk-Disagreement,mhum,https://www.metafilter.com/user/19040,"While closing a bunch of old browser tabs, I happened to stumble across this Roxane Gay op-ed for the NYT from two weeks after the Kirk assassination and thought it a propos to revisit, "" Civility is a Fantasy (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/opinion/civility-fantasy-power-kirk.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ok8.2ekW.yooo9wXkJKQX) "" ( archive.is link (https://archive.is/eoL9d) ): Civility is the mode of engagement that is often demanded in political discourse; it is the price of admission to important political conversation, its adherents would have us believe; no civility, no service. But civility — this idea that there is a perfect, polite way to communicate about sociopolitical differences — is a fantasy. The people who call for civility harbor the belief that we can contend with challenging ideas, and we can be open to changing our minds, and we can be well mannered even in the face of significant differences. For such an atmosphere to exist, we would have to forget everything that makes us who we are. We would have to believe, despite so much evidence to the contrary, that the world is a fair and just place. And we would have to have nothing at stake. In the fantasy of civility, if we are polite about our disagreements, we are practicing politics the right way. If we are polite when we express bigotry, we are performing respectability for people whom we do not actually respect and who, in return, do not respect us. The performance is the only thing that matters. Civility obsessives love a silver-tongued devil, wearing a nice suit, sporting a tidy haircut, while whispering sweet bigotries. The conservatives among them push for marginalized people to lose their rights and freedoms and, sometimes, even risk their lives. They will tolerate a protest but only if you congregate in an orderly fashion, for culturally sanctioned causes, and if you don’t raise your voice or express anger or overstay your welcome. Within this framework, incivility is refusing to surrender to hatred, refusing to smile politely at someone who doesn’t consider you their equal, refusing to carve away the seemingly unpalatable parts of yourself until there is nothing left. To be uncivil means pointing out hypocrisies and misinformation. It means accurately acknowledging what people have said, with ample documentation and holding them accountable for their words and deeds. It means protesting injustice while recognizing that protest isn’t supposed to be demure or mindful. It means exercising one’s constitutionally protected right to free speech. It means believing in science and factual information and public education and other such heretical ideas. Civility is a cage that we’re supposed to lock ourselves into and then we are expected to be grateful for our incarceration. And the notion of two groups— civil and not — is predicated on the idea that we’re all playing by the same rules, and we’re standing on equal footing, untroubled by the inequities and bigotries of the world. As I said, civility is a fantasy, because our political discourse never happens in a vacuum. It happens in the beautiful mess of the real world. It is naïve, at best, to believe civility is more important than who we are, what we stand for and how. I genuinely wonder if Ezra Klein has read this or not",7 favorites,"['https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/opinion/civility-fantasy-power-kirk.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ok8.2ekW.yooo9wXkJKQX', 'https://archive.is/eoL9d', '/favorited/2/8773686']",2025-10-08 16:54:00,Wednesday

They won't do that, though, because they are not fundamentally opposed to a reign of terror against the poor and powerless. Okay, I believe this. BUT making it happen is a long slog and you  can't draw back your hand once you start. How is Pritzger going to call people up and who is he going to call up? How will he arm them? How will he pay them? How will they be trained? It won't be the cops, the most heavily armed force in most states. If actual federal troops roll in, the cops will be on their side, just like they're on ICE's side. Like, you are de facto talking about  building to building fighting. You are talking about the people of Chicago going against a much better armed force. You are talking about people going out there knowing they will be shot and sometimes killed. And remember what was done to MOVE (by the police). If the feds start dropping munitions on American cities, there's no amount of heroic state level resistance that will be able to deal with that, and there's absolutely nothing that leads me to believe they won't. The Trump administration would absolutely bomb American civilians and then post memes about it. I think Pritzger is a good guy and I honestly think that if there's a major politician in the US who would be at least somewhat willing to think through these questions, it's him. At the same time, these are really tough questions and I don't fault any governor for hesitating under current conditions. As DOT says, this has been a long, long time coming. The points where it could easily be stopped by state level resistance have long been passed.

I was struck by this: Jones, who lives on the fourth floor, said most of his neighbors were Venezuelan and often took turns cleaning the hallway because the property owners did little to maintain it. “They were cool people,” Jones said as he looked into his next door neighbor’s unit. “They didn’t speak a lick of English, but we used translator apps to talk to each other.” I always think of translator apps as being used by privileged tourists somewhere. In the midst of this horror, it was a glint of encouragement to me to read about someone doing his best to connect and communicate with his neighbors.

Piling onto someone who a bunch of you have arbitrarily decided is a troll (in Russian, no less, or curses) just because that person doesn't want to add comments to a public post with their suggestions for how to respond to federal armed forces, among other bad-faith readings of what they actually said, is not useful or the kind of thing we should be doing here. It seems like people might be doing that because that commenter had some vague critical things to say about ""liberals"" this or that. Sure, specific suggestions might be more useful than vague critiques are, but it's probably good to remember that someone might have apprehensions or criticisms about the efficacy of liberal leaders' approach to dealing with a situation like this—or about what might safely be posted about it—and still not actually be, like, your enemy. As others have noted, one of the big reasons we have governments is so they deal with things like this on our behalf, rather than people deputizing themselves the militia and deciding to take some kind of action on their own. I understand that that might not be working great at the moment—or at least we don't yet know all of the options there might be to address what's happening—but demanding that people pony up some kind of hot plans here, and refusing to accept any replies that don't provide that, is itself trolling, counterproductive, and weirdly hawkish.

ICE is still getting paid and still terrorizing the general public, but we can't go to a national park, how the fuck does that make sense and who wrote the rules so that during a ""government shutown"" only the shit we care about is stopped while every one of the Republican parts of government is operating at what looks like full capicity and without any problems? Much as I favor the D's finally finding their spine, I can't help but notice that the one action they did have available to impede Trump doesn't seem to have done much beyond stop the few remaining good parts of the govenrment from functioning while leaving the evil parts working just fine. More generally, as far as resistence goes, I think the local city governments are impeded by two things, first being a reluctance to actually take steps that are unequivicobly against Trump/ICE/DHS/whatever by (for example) tearing out the roads around all of their buildings or whatever, and second by the part where their own pigs are all in on Trump and will actively work for Trump and against the city government. if the mayor of Chicago did start trying to tear out roads around DHS and ICE buildings, the Chicago police would stop it from happening, and probably arrest the mayor for good measure. Not to say they shouldn't TRY, but... One possible thought? And it's dangerous, risky, likely not legally workable, and would be an escalation to physical force? A city law stating that any person with their face covered and/or not displaying a badge with their name and ID number is, legally speaking, NOT law enforcement and it is the right and duty of people to physically oppose those not law enforcement people if they try to kidnap anyone or otherwise pretend to carry out law enforcement actions. Any mask wearing person claiming to be ICE, by city law, is by definition not ICE and no citizen can be arrested, fined, procecuted, or otherwise messed with if they impede the fuck out of the masked criminals falsely claiming to be ICE. It probably wouldn't work. But it's better than a law saying they can't cover their faces, becuase they'll just break that law. A law saying people with face coverings are instantly and automatically not granted any of the usual law enforcement powers, respect, legal cover, amplified charges for impeding, etc is self enforcing. Or it would be until the Supreme Court said it wasn't legal, but maybe we could get a couple days of work out of it.

Extensively check that every single federal agent and military member is a legal member of the federal agency and military.  Prosecute and arrest those who refuse to comply with such checks as failing to obey a lawful police order.  Do this everywhere.

Ban urban use of heavy trucks even for law enforcement purposes except on specific arteries as a traffic safety measure.  Pass laws making wearing body armor illegal without a permit from state authorities. 4. Call up the national guard.  Have them film federal units and document all constitutional violations.  Have them rotate regularly, and check the identity and documentation of every federal unit they interact with.  Fly the state flag with each such unit.  Get the state national guard patriotic for the State and its Citizens, and show the flag. 5.

Small wonder ICE often seems to need our respected military to guard them as they go about implementing our immigration laws. It should be noted that our troops do not ordinarily wear masks. Can you imagine a masked marine? It is a matter of honor—and honor still matters. To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police. Carrying on in this fashion, ICE brings indelible obloquy to this administration and everyone who works in it. (The fine folks at Electoral-Vote.com have summarized and excerpted the ruling (https://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2025/Items/Oct01-3.html) , but the whole thing is worth reading.) For me, it's really important to note that many, many people, including Republican-appointed federal judges, strongly oppose so much of what this administration is doing.

Citroën president Pierre-Jules Boulanger knew he couldn't just refuse to produce anything, but he also knew there's no way in hell he's going to just roll over and build trucks for a bunch of filthy Nazis. Pierre had a plan. John Reynold's book Citroën 2CV describes Boulanger's sabotage efforts. Of course, he instructed workers to set a nice, leisurely pace when building trucks (likely Citroën T45 trucks) for the Wermacht, but that's fairly obvious. What was brilliant was Boulanger's idea to move the little notch on the trucks' oil dipsticks that indicated the proper level of oil down just a bit lower. By moving the notch down, the trucks would not have enough oil, but German mechanics would have no idea, because, hey, the little notch on the dipstick says its just fine. Then, after the truck has been used for a while and is out deployed somewhere crucial, whammo, the engine seizes up, and you've got a lot of angry, stranded, vulnerable Nazis, balling up their little fists and redly barking curses in German",42 favorites,"['https://www.jalopnik.com/citroen-sabotaged-wartime-nazi-truck-production-in-a-si-1836670685/', '/favorited/2/8771659']",2025-10-02 12:35:00,Thursday

The explanation runs much deeper."" Prominent conservatives, like the Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, had urged business leaders to fund opposition to government intervention in the economy and other threats to free enterprise.[ 1 (https://www.metafilter.com/210106/Capitalism-Without-Democracy) ] Their efforts helped pave the way for the deregulation of industries like airlines, media, telecom and finance... Within a decade, the incentives of chief executives had completely changed... By the 1980s, chief executives had to spend their waking hours plotting to maximize their share price, or find themselves out on their ear. After relatively little turnover among the country’s largest corporations throughout the 20th century, almost one-third of the Fortune 500 companies vanished in the 1980s, many because of hostile takeovers. ...in the era of shareholder capitalism, the overseers of ABC and CBS must keep their eyes on the stock price. And by that measure they have been in no position to push back. The parent companies of both networks, Disney and Paramount, have seen their market value drop sharplyover the past four years amid intense competition from streamers like Netflix and Amazon. In fact, these same considerations may help explain Jimmy Kimmel’s return to his late-night perch. It was hard not to notice that Disney’s share price dropped amid the outrage over the host’s suspension, as customers began to cancel subscriptions to its streaming services. What’s true for companies may now also be true for democratic norms: Live by the share price, die by the share price. Larry Ellison, a Media Mogul Like No Other (https://archive.ph/kAasa) - ""The database billionaire and his son, David, are Trump favorites. The family could soon control an empire that includes CBS, Paramount, Warner, CNN and a piece of TikTok."" also btw... You explain Oracle to a teenager like this (https://xcancel.com/rsthau/status/1305343778245533701) - ""As you know people, as you learn about things, you realize that these generalizations we have are, virtually to a generalization, false. Well, except for this one, as it turns out. What you think of Oracle, is even truer than you think it is. There has been no entity in human history with less complexity or nuance to it than Oracle. And I gotta say, as someone who has seen that complexity for my entire life, it's very hard to get used to that idea. It's like, 'surely this is more complicated!' but it's like: Wow, this is really simple! This company is very straightforward, in its defense. This company is about one man, his alter-ego, and what he wants to inflict upon humanity -- that's it! ...Ship mediocrity, inflict misery, lie our asses off, screw our customers, and make a whole shitload of money. Yeah... you talk to Oracle, it's like, 'no, we don't fucking make dreams happen -- we make money!' ...You need to think of Larry Ellison the way you think of a lawnmower. You don't anthropomorphize your lawnmower, the lawnmower just mows the lawn, you stick your hand in there and it'll chop it off, the end. You don't think 'oh, the lawnmower hates me' -- lawnmower doesn't give a shit about you, lawnmower can't hate you. Don't anthropomorphize the lawnmower.

Here’s what I found: Once fascists win power democratically, they have never been removed democratically. Not once. Ever. […] No wealthy democracy with nuclear weapons has ever fallen to fascism. The 1930s examples everyone cites were broken countries. Weimar Germany was weakened by World War I and hyperinflation. Italy was barely industrialized. Spain was largely agrarian. They didn’t have the world’s reserve currency or thousands of nukes or surveillance technology that would make the Stasi weep with envy. America has all of that.

Find something where you can do regular, ideally weekly, work with/for people outside your own community. As you make those connections, more work will become clearer to you. You will also hear about more efforts to assist/resist. Bear in mind that depending on your experience and depending on your background, this may be a culture shock. My project had a volunteer who really did not strike me as likely to fit in and stay due to background, initial beliefs and general manner, and that volunteer is actually one of our most involved volunteers now. I think we were a culture shock for that person, and I think they didn't totally know too much about the situation, but in their heart they were ready. My point being that you've got to get yourself a network, and that network can't be isolated from other networks, and you need to do at least some of that in person.  Many people literally can't find things to do except joining DSA (and finding it too much about electoral stuff) or looking at and generally being discouraged by a platformist organization. (If your local DSA or platformist group has a subgroup for work with unhoused folks, etc, this is different - our local DSA is doing good work.) Honestly, you would be better off, like, volunteering at your local film society and just talking to your fellow volunteers than staying home. I am sure that virtually everyone likely to be congenial to mefites is horrified and afraid at what is happening, and if you meet a group of them, you will inevitably meet someone who can recommend something like ""if you love volunteering at the film society, you would love connecting with this immigration solidarity group, let me connect you"". There is work for everyone. In my project, we have work that can be done largely remotely. We have work that can be done by people who need stay seated, can't lift heavy things, have trouble talking to strangers, etc. You do not need to get swole for the revolution - the revolution needs some swole people for practical reasons, but it needs everyone of good will. Obviously you can in the moment do other things if you have the connections and the ability, but if you are not sure what to do, it will be useful in the medium long term to connect with on the ground projects.On the ground projects will teach you more about the world faster than anything else.

Would it make sense to tear up a road? Is this the moment where people of good conscience need to throw themselves in the gears no matter what the consequence? Does it make sense to get your senator to come to Broadview? Do you need a food/bus token/clothing drive for displaced people? I don't know! And you may not either! We do not need to know at this point much less in this thread. Situations develop. That's not to say there's never any debate on the ground - not at all! But at least when everyone is looking at the same thing and has been around for a minute, the terms of the debate are much clearer. It is really tempting to try to solve something remotely and immediately because uncertainty is scary and these times are fucking terrifying. And I think personally that it is fine to kick ideas around to the extent that is wise online. But we don't know what to do because we're not there and we're not involved and this is as everyone is saying an unprecedented situation",15 favorites,['/favorited/2/8771888'],2025-10-03 05:55:00,Friday

They did not know each other until that moment. They quickly bonded over the fact they both had been recruited to work for a private company contracted to ICE. Different companies. One said he had been offered early prison release in exchange for an agreement to do whatever ICE asked of him. The other said he was ex military and they enticed him with a huge incentive signing bonus. These were both poor men, marginalized, also fucked over by the system. That's who they're ordering to attack us all on behalf of white billionaires. Which means that if Americans defend themselves against the coming violence, they will be killing people the administration won't miss. What we are seeing in Chicago the past 24 hours is a mere prelude. The official numbers of agents is nothing compared to the prisoners private contractors are releasing to kidnap, disappear and kill their fellow Americans. This suggests the covered faces are less about protecting the contractors and more about hiding from the public that prisoners are being used for this.

https://www.metafilter.com/210538/The-Invasion-of-Chicago,bcd,https://www.metafilter.com/user/274961,"From the 7th Circuit ruling, courtesy of Marcy Wheeler (https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/10/16/how-city-of-chicago-beat-back-stephen-millers-shoddy-propaganda-so-far/) : Although we substantially agree with the definition of rebellion set forth by the district court in Newsom, we emphasize that the critical analysis of a “rebellion” centers on the nature of the resistance to governmental authority. Political opposition is not rebellion. A protest does not become a rebellion merely because the protestors advocate for myriad legal or policy changes, are well organized, call for significant changes to the structure of the U.S. government, use civil disobedience as a form of protest, or exercise their Second Amendment right to carry firearms as the law currently allows. Nor does a protest become a rebellion merely because of sporadic and isolated incidents of unlawful activity or even violence committed by rogue participants in the protest. Such conduct exceeds the scope of the First Amendment, of course, and law enforcement has apprehended the perpetrators accordingly. But because rebellions at least use deliberate, organized violence to resist governmental authority, the problematic incidents in this record clearly fall within the considerable daylight between protected speech and rebellion. Applying our tentative understanding of “rebellion” to the district court’s factual findings, and even after affording great deference to the President’s evaluation of the circumstances, we see insufficient evidence of a rebellion or danger of rebellion in Illinois. The spirited, sustained, and occasionally violent actions of demonstrators in protest of the federal government’s immigration policies and actions, without more, does not give rise to a danger of rebellion against the government’s authority. The administration thus has not demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on this issue. The above is just a snippet from an update at the end of the article.  There's lots more context that's worth reading",5 favorites,"['https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/10/16/how-city-of-chicago-beat-back-stephen-millers-shoddy-propaganda-so-far/', '/favorited/2/8776184']",2025-10-16 14:04:00,Thursday

A very nice summary of the problem. Generalizations about Christians and Christianity in general -- and this is speaking from an atheist's perspective here, not someone with skin actively in that game -- are dangerous because they paint many different kinds and groups of people with the same brush. There are millions of people who wouldn't hesitate to call themselves Christian and maybe go to church once or twice a year (if at all), who don't consult the Bible on everyday or even major decisions, who follow the general examples of the figures in the Bible without thinking about them too hard.  There are millions who call themselves Christians who choose to consciously weave Biblical teachings and principles into their lives to a greater degree than that.  There are millions who subscribe to a worldview in which being Christian makes you a better person than someone who is not, converting others to that worldview is important, and suppressing behaviors that don't fit into your personal standards is equally important.  There are millions who wield the Bible like a bludgeon, intent on literally removing personal choice from outsiders and seizing control of everything possible in the name of Because God Says So. Umpteen branches and denominations, all of whom have their own spin of sorts on the same founding texts, some of whom quite literally consider other denominations heretics and blasphemers.  We just watched the Methodist church -- hardly some fly-by-night upstart -- fragment into two over LGBT issues within the past year or two.  Some quiet suburban church in a liberal area, an evangelical church in a rural town, and a gathering of Dominionists bent on seizing control and purging the unbelievers may be nominally playing the same game with the same core rulebook... but with different jerseys, different fields and very different rules enforced. Jack Chick, the man behind the millions of little paper tracts that litter our landscapes, once got things absolutely correct in two panels (https://imgur.com/a/SM3y9BN) .  Once and once only.  There are people who spread the word of God in an attempt to help them, and there are people who do so explicitly for personal gain (urged on here by a demonic figure in minor disguise, to drive the point home with a sledgehammer).  Of course, that tract immediately devolved into a diatribe as to how Catholicism was inherently demonic, but it at least demonstrated at least a momentary flash of clarity as to how religion is misused. Charlie Kirk misused religion.  There's no other way to put it.  His ideal world, his goal, was an America in which the non-religious, the lesser races, the sexual Other, the female gender, everyone outside of the preferred group go back to knowing their place, acknowledging their inferiority, and going along with whatever the straight WASP conservative males decide is best for everyone.  He chose that path and desired to remove that choice from others, and worked hard to try to make that a reality and roll back decades of social and cultural and political progress in the name of Jesus. If there is a greater sin, I'm not sure what it is",15 favorites,"['https://imgur.com/a/SM3y9BN', '/favorited/2/8770027']",2025-09-28 08:55:00,Sunday

The congregation has a lot of young blue families and some aging lefties, balanced almost evenly by a lot of deep red senior citizens who are the biggest financial donors. When he came here in mid-2022, our pastor, knowing this, walked a fine line. But since Gaza and then increasingly during the ramped-up snatch-and-grab deportations, he's been pushing back more and more. Today he went into the Presbyterian version of DGAF mode. The gospel reading was from Luke 16, the ""no servant can serve two masters"" verse that leads into the parable of the story of the rich man who goes to hell because he ignored the suffering of homeless Lazarus. (Different Lazarus from the usual one.) In his sermon, the pastor eventually pivoted to the memorial service for Charlie Kirk. He quoted Kirk's wife saying she would forgive the killer (I know, oversimplifying), and quoted Trump saying ""That's where I differ from Charlie. I hate my opponents and I don't want the best for them."" The pastor noted that the memorial service crowd clapped for *both* lines. And so then he said (I'm quoting from the recorded stream): ""You and I have two very different choices as citizens, and particularly as Christians: Will we choose the path of love, or will we choose the path of hate? Will we choose the path of forgiveness or will we choose the path of revenge? Will we choose the path of compassion... or will we choose the path of contempt? ... If we are to take this parable seriously, if we are to take Jesus seriously,  the path we decide to take matters -- not only for this life but for the life to come."" ""So the question before you, before this whole country, is, how are we going to move forward? What is our choice going to be? And the thing that we all need to remember is, whatever choice you are going to make,  you can clap for one or the other, but you don't get to clap for both -- at least, not in Jesus' name."" OK, not the rafters-rattling of a Baptist sermon, but in the reserved Presbyterian faith that's a lot. His message was clear: Follow Jesus and be compassionate and go to heaven, or follow Trump and hate people and go to hell. I often catch up with him after to talk about the sermon and more about the writing process. He texted me a little while ago to say that it went over well at the early contemporary music service (which I attend) but it made the older and redder people at the later service uncomfortable-- but ""only one scolding so far.""

The first person on record as saying some variant of ""kill them all and let God sort it out"" was  Arnaud Amalric, Pope Innocent III's legate, and the guy who ordered the massacre at Béziers way back in 1209. He's almost certainly not the first person to express that sentiment, but he is the first one we have on record. Amalric said it because the Cathars they meant to massacre were difficult/impossible to distinguish from the orthodox Catholics. So he ordered that everyone be killed on the grounds that God would welcome the martyred to Heaven so it wouldn't really hurt them in the long run. You'll note that predates Trump and MAGA by quite a bit. And that's just the first example that springs to mind. We could equally talk about Torquemada, or Heinrich Kramer, or Peter the Hermit, or Martin Luther, or J. W. Tucker. There have always been at least two Christianities, and the MAGA version has been dominant  for most of the history of Christianity. I'd like it if the not-MAGA version of Christianity was the prevailing one, but it mostly hasn't been. And, I'll note, the MAGA Christians say the not-MAGA Christians aren't the ones who aren't real Christians.  And they've got the weight of history on their side. I hope the not-MAGA Christians can emerge victorious and win the PR campaign to label the MAGA Christians as not actually Christian. But I'm doubtful that will work, it hasn't before. I'm glad that people get some solace out of more or less anything they can. If Christianity is your go to source for solace, I'm not saying you should stop. But I am saying that expecting anyone to agree that a) there actually IS one singular true Christianity, and b) it's the not-MAGA variety, is probably futile and a bit irksome to the people being asked to accept that proposition",9 favorites,['/favorited/2/8770062'],2025-09-28 11:22:00,Sunday

And they've got the weight of history on their side. Yup, if your idealistic movement has at some point in the past achieved some sort of political power it's going to have a seriously comprimised moral history. Sometimes it can have one even if it didn't. Who are the real progressives -- folks who are anti-US imperialism or pro? Historically it's the latter (see both Roosevelt presidents, JFK, LBJ, etc.), so I guess that means when people say invading other countries isn't progressive they're not taking that history seriously. Who are the real feminists? The ones who are interested in addressing intersectional injustices or the ones just interested in furthering the cause of white, cisgender women? The latter seems to have been in the driver's seat for a lot of the history of the movement, so I guess saying that leaving trans folks and people of colour behind is anti-feminist just doesn't take history seriously enough. We're smart enough on Metafilter to distinguish between descriptive and prescriptive speech acts, right? History is a giant garbage dump of people failing to live up to their ideals, failing to think through the logical implications of what those ideals entail, choosing power over consistency, and using the language of their ideals to justify horrors. Christianity has a particularly long history and an accompanying warehouse of all of the above to choose from. If you do enough historical theology sometimes you even get to watch in real time as Christian theologians realise they're doing it and forge ahead anyway -- a particular favourite of mine being Vitoria finishing up his De Indis with a, 'Huh, to be consistent I'm going to have to say Charles V has to give up this whole overseas colonialism thing, but that doesn't work financially so... guess I'll be inconsistent!' But just because history is littered with these sorts of failures doesn't mean its not worth continuing to fight to define what is and isn't Christian, just as it's worth fighting over what is and isn't American, feminist, progressive, etc",7 favorites,['/favorited/2/8770078'],2025-09-28 12:39:00,Sunday

When I started learning about it in the early 90s there was a diverse set of authoritative time sources: WWVB, a few genuine atomic clocks, and maybe a couple of GPS receivers. Now GPS is by far the primary source of stratum 0 time. The neat thing is NTP does have systems in place to detect bad clocks and work around them. Unfortunately it's mostly a majority voting thing, so if GPS is corrupted but still working all of NTP will be corrupted too. But at least people would notice. Not really related but this recent article (https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/06/10/timing-conclusions/) about practical NTP accuracy limits is fascinating.

The 1986 gubernatorial election in Arizona had a piss-poor turnout, because neither candidate was all that great.  The guy who won, Evan Mecham, won mainly because he had a biggish fanatical group of fans.  And when he got into office, one of his first acts was to cancel MLK Day as a state holiday in Arizona.  (That's why U2 was talking about it, they announced that they would boycott the state - something which fanatical U2-fan me paid attention to.) That was just the beginning.  He repeatedly blew off cooperating with the legislature, because he said he only followed the United States Constitution—which he believed was divinely inspired. His Head of the Department of Liquor Licenses and Control was being investigated for a murder charge.  His director of the Department of Revenue was the former CEO of a company that was in arrears by $25,000 on employment compensation payments.  His supervisor of prison construction served prison time for armed robbery.  He nominated a former Marine to be a state investigator who had been court-martialled twice. His education adviser, James Cooper, told a legislative committee, ""If a student wants to say the world is flat, the teacher doesn't have the right to prove otherwise"".  His special assistant was charged with extortion.  He was paranoid about people eavesdropping on him, to the point that he sent a staffer crawling through the dropped ceiling in his office looking for ""bugs""; the staffer fell through the ceiling and broke his leg.  He said that at home, he always had a radio on ""to keep the lasers out"".  He claimed that high divorce rates were caused by working women, claimed America is a Christian nation to a Jewish audience, and said a group of visiting Japanese businessmen got ""round eyes"" after being told of the number of golf courses in Arizona. He said something so offensive about African-Americans that MeFi will not let me post the word.  When challenged on his racist comments, he literally said ""but I have black friends"" in his own defense.  A number of other people were boycotting Arizona in response to his cancelling  MLK day; the only one he really commented on was the NBA, and even then he just said ""I guess the NBA doesn't get how many white people go to their games."" Finally, after 9 months in office, he was impeached because he'd embezzled some of his campaign funds to help offset expenses in a used car dealership he'd owned. Now - I'd been following all of this in 1987 because it was so outrageous.  And it occurred to me that the biggest reason he'd even gotten into office was because most people had sat out the election, leaving things to a bunch of fanatical Ev Mecham supporters.  And so I make a point of voting as often as I can - because even if you're only trying to pick the lesser of two evils, like the people of Arizona were in 1986, it still make sense to vote just to make sure you get the lesser. The election of 1988 was my first.  I think I voted Dukakis in the primary as well as the general election (I feared that George Bush Sr. would just be another 4 years of Reagan-era bullshit); and I voted absentee so I could help flip a Senate seat to the Dems",10 favorites,['/favorited/2/8763300'],2025-09-08 07:25:00,Monday

Didn't regret it then, don't really regret it now given the alternative, other than recognizing how non-left US Democrats have been since, well, ever. Film student update: worked on a short project Saturday as camera operator, with much of the same crew as the last indie short film.   It's a dialogue-free, spooky interpretation of struggling with mental illness.     There was a lot of fun stuff -- smoke machine, people dressed as ghosts, old-timey telephones ringing unexpectedly, and a huge rig which rotated 90 degrees, turning the wall into the floor, upon which our game and trusting actor stood and then laid down as she rotated with the wall/floor. The scariest thing, though:   we were swapping lenses on my camera and the DOP was handing me the next lens -- and his finger caught on part of it, it missed my palm, and it hit the ground with a nasty crunch .    Picked it up, and the glass on the front was covered in gnarly cracks (https://www.instagram.com/p/DOS3vBVjWmR/) .   This, however, was working as expected:  every lens I own has a clear/UV filter on the front, so it will take damage before the lens does when shit like this inevitably happens.    I learned this from experience long, long ago. It took some work to remove the filter, since it bent in the impact, but a quick examination of the lens itself found no issues at all.    The DOP was so shaken and upset, he kept apologizing and I kept reassuring him that everything was OK. The other, more tragic part of the day:  my wife has been saying that our senior cat hasn't seemed like himself for the last couple weeks, but otherwise seemed healthy, then he took a turn for the worse Saturday morning in a very scary and gross way; I took him to the vet in the morning and handled it until I had to be on set, then my wife took over when she woke up after working an overnight shift.  Unfortunately, that means she got all the bad news  and had to handle it on her own since I was hard to reach, and we had to put him to sleep that night.

I don't even remember the candidate I voted for in my riding, it feels so long ago, but it would have been the NDP candidate, whom I usually voted for in every Federal and Provincial election. I was actually excited about voting. I voted in Squamish, BC, which was home at the time, and as usually the case with elections in Canada it was a well mannered well run affair. A quick note. I live in Vancouver and are mayor, Ken Sim, is a sock puppet for Chip Wilson, yes, that Chip Wilson, of LuluLemon fame, and the developer community here. People are so upset with him that we had a large turnout for a recent bye election for two council seats. Sim's government greatly reduced polling stations and election workers from the previous civic election and it was a cluster fuck, long lines and long waits to vote, but I managed to drive to a station that only had a half hour wait. Two progressive candidates won the two seats by large margins, and the two Ken Sim approved candidates, including an ex-cop, were trashed. So, that was lovely. One of the hardest things to witness in my life since I became of age to vote has been the massive shift to the right in politics.

They even kept me longer in the hospital because I was struggling with the pain so much. My mother was active in the Danish Left Party, which is actually a pretty hard right party. So I grew up meeting a lot of politicians, some of whom I still admire though I disagree with them politically. And of course a strong sense of duty when it comes to voting. My first vote was in 1981, and I can't remember who I voted for. It could have been anyone from the ""Radical Left"", who are in real life radical centrists, or the ""Socialist People's Party"" which sounds like a Soviet project but was actually a group of former communists who separated out after Hungary in 1956. Or the ""Left Socialists"" who moved out of the Socialist People's Party because they were more radical but still hated the Soviets. I have only once voted for our ruling Social Democrats, and that was after COVID, because I think our PM did a great job. But they are a bit too power-hungry and corrupt for my taste. I was once explicitly asked to join ""the party"", for reasons, but declined. I've always brought my kids along to vote, they get candy and there is a festive atmosphere with lots of local families they know from kindergarten or school. I've never been an election official because you have to be a party member, and I've never wanted to register with any party. When we got home, I'd make fried pork belly with potatoes and parsley gravy, which is a tradition here, pork belly has the same political associations here as in the US, and somehow we all still find it hilarious to eat it on election days. This summer has not been good. I have felt a bit lost and my PTSD has been acting up. But today I was at a job interview, and while I won't say it felt great in the moment, I will say that I felt great having written the application and made it to the interview. Cross your fingers for me, because I would really, really like this job. It's a great organisation, they are super smart and I feel very aligned with their values.

That was a civilized practice that should be the standard everywhere. Voting by mail here in Oregon is good and all but it’s kind of anticlimactic.

(I'm sure no one said anything about a provisional ballot or any other options I would have had, because I would have done whatever I could have, I'm sure.) Since then, I have voted every chance I got - primaries, off-year elections (what does that even mean? people are still running for office! sheesh), special elections. Both of my parents voted regularly, but I think it was school that most instilled in me that it was important to vote. As a result, I am now considered a ""super voter"", which resulted, one year, in a candidate for city council specifically ringing my bell at my apartment building to canvass me. (She was great. I wish she would have gotten elected.) Unlike lots of folks in this thread, I have been fortunate to be very enthusiastic about several of the people I've voted for, for president on down to very local races.

https://www.metafilter.com/210257/How-was-your-first-time-its-your-free-thread,juliebug,https://www.metafilter.com/user/11459,"My first vote was on October 30, 1995. It was the Quebec referendum on whether or not Quebec should separate from Canada. I am (and have always been) a very strong proponent of a united Canada, despite understanding (in theory) why so many of my fellow Quebecois(es) insist that a ""free"" Quebec would be a better Quebec. (My mom's side of the family has been in Quebec since the 1660s.) What I remember most was the real, palpable fear that Quebec could secede from Canada within days of the vote. I mean, of course there would be legal challenges, etc, ad nauseum, but what if an overwhelming majority, say 65%+ of votes, wanted to secede from Canada? And, being in Montreal, many of us wondered if we Montrealers could secede from Quebec. It was a really frightening time for many of us who wanted to remain in Canada. As recently as three days before the election, the YES side was in the lead in the polls by quite a large margin, considering how tight the polls had been. I remember going to a nearby elementary school gymnasium to vote. I remember carefully marking the ballot on the ""NO"" option. I even remember asking my parents that morning (and even asking the deputy returning officer at the voting station) what mark I should make. I made a checkmark. And I folded up my ballot and left the voting booth, shortly thereafter putting my ballot in the box, feeling proud that I had voted the way I had, and having a sinking feeling in my stomach about how the rest of the day was going to go. I couldn't sit still that night as we waited for the polls to close. I took a large Canadian flag we had picked up somewhere in the last few weeks and taped it to a meter stick and just stood outside, waving the flag as cars came down the street. I got a lot of supportive honks, but some shouted at me in French and some flipped birds. Shortly before the polls closed, we all headed to a friend of the family's place to watch the results come in. It took a while. And then it happened. The ""No"" side, my side, was declared the winner. I like to think I'm a decent writer, but I still could never manage to put into words the pure joy and, most of all, relief that we all felt that night. On the way home, I was waving the Canadian flag out the car window. We saw a group of three people, probably not much older than me, walking in the street, holding a placard. We honked at them joyously. They turned their placard around to show that they were OUI voters -- separatists. And it was a moment that I'll never forget. So united were my family and our friends and I in our joy, we forgot that not everyone was happy about the result. As a result of this enormous event being my first vote, I've missed exactly one provincial or federal election since 1995, and often vote in municipal elections if the candidates have any competition. I worked at the polls for years as a deputy returning officer, for both Quebec and Canada elections. I've been there at 12:15am still counting my votes. I've been the one who's told new, first-time voters, that a distinct mark in one of the circles is all that's needed to count -- it can be a checkmark, an X, just about anything, as long as it's a distinct mark in one circle. I've smiled at them as they've nervously handed me back their ballot so I could tear off the counterfoil. I've encouraged them to put the ballot into the box themselves. Working during those elections was such a wonderful experience, seeing all these people, young and old, coming in to vote for their first time or their 30th time. For I know that even one vote can make all the difference in the world. 4,757,509 people in Quebec voted on October 30, 1995. That's a turnout of 93.52% of the entire Quebec population who was eligible to vote, at that time. The final numbers: Yes: 2,308,360 (49.42%) No: 2,363,648 (50.58%) Invalid/blank ballots: 86,501 Total number of people who did not vote: 329,500 Total difference between the No and Yes side: 55,288 If people hadn't had ballots rejected, or hadn't protested the vote with blank ballots/spoiled ballots, or if even just over a sixth of the people who didn't vote had voted YES... who's to say what would have happened? There's a lot of ugliness around this subject too -- racism and xenophobia and such that I don't want to get into.

My father, a working class steel worker with ambitions but no education,(he left school at 13), came of age in the late 1930s and like many of his peers in the North East UK was a Stalinist, absolutely convinced that Uncle Joe would rescue the working man after he'd finished with the Nazis. My mother, as bright as a button, was also uneducated. She was whipped out of school at 10 when her Dad died and she had to take care of her younger siblings so her Mum could go out to work in a local enamel dipping factory. My Mum's roots were in Antrim, Northern Ireland and a family history scarred by the Black and Tans, her politics were Irish Republican and violently anti British. She was a life long supporter of the IRA. My earliest political memory was a news item on the BBC announcing the death of Stalin. I must have been 3 or so.  I grew up with a conviction that ""Bourgeois Democracy"" was a charade and that voting served primarily to sustain that charade. Later, I studied politics at university, did a phd in politics and later still ended up as a politics prof. My views of the importance of voting became more nuanced, now it seemed to the citizen within, more like a possibly if modestly useful action 'tho' never a duty. Au contraire. I struggled to integrate my sense of myself as a citizen and as a professional. Still do. When I was 60 I had a number of job offers and opted to take up a position in China largely because I wanted to experience daily life as a regular Joe living in a non democratic society. Would it feel any different? Would I experience freedom in the same way? Would I be less free and if I were what would that look like? The experiment was a failure.

I spoke about the Ev Mecham Effect upthread.  That's what shifted me from my father's more cynical view, actually - the very first time I remember being in a voting booth, I was like seven or eight and Dad brought me in with him when my parents went to vote.  I think it was a state or local election, and he snickered and did a local DJ as a write-in candidate (and then had to explain to me later why he'd written something down instead of using one of the levers). Before I was born, my father was actually active enough in politics that he was a volunteer for the Robert F. Kennedy campaign.  And something that happened on the primary election day kind of soured him on activism; he and a partner were sent out to drop in at the homes of registered voters and offer them a ride to the polls.  Most people had voted already.  Then they got to one house - the person there was a registered Democrat, but he had also only recently moved there from San Juan, and barely spoke English and didn't really seem to understand what they were trying to tell him.  Dad started to make his apologies and leave - but his partner just grinned and said, ""that's okay, we'll help you!""  And Dad watched him start walking the guy to the door, telling him ""when you get there, just remember to pull the lever all the way on the left.  The blue one."" It felt skeevy, understandably, and Dad dropped out of activism altogether at that point. ...My parents are both fortunately pretty solidly center-left, edging towards left.  I've always chalked that up to Dad having worked on a military contract in the late 1960s and being told some nuclear secrets; he likely got the crap scared out of him and it drove him away from the GOP permanently.

Here, we do it all with paper and pencil and everyone's good. Both in the US and here in tiny Denmark, voting is managed locally. Nobody is counting 200 million votes or whatever it is, they are just counting their local results. BTW, we don't have mail in votes in the exact same way that you do in the US, but we do have other ways to ensure people can vote early, or if they can't get to the voting place or if they are abroad. Anyways, congrats to the Norwegian government and all Norwegian friends. Today I've been on a train journey and got a lot of work done, as well as a lot of phone games. It was very nice, I should do more train traveling. The views were gorgeous because it was a mild, bright day. There is a song in Danish that starts: September's ceiling is so blue, its clouds so white and bright. We hear the lark strike loud and clear,  like in the spring before. The rye is growing from the soil, with light green shards standing tall,  and the stork has left a while ago, with sunshine on its wings .

They had some sort of fake ballot to keep kids entertained while their parents voted. There wasn't much of a line at the Boulder Creek polling place, so I don't think I had time to finish it. I spent most of my childhood in Oregon, and that's where I first voted, in November 2002. Oregon had already been using universal vote by mail for three years at that point, so I have never had to go to a polling place to vote. As a result I have never missed an election in the past 23 years, and never really understood other people's fascination with ""I voted"" stickers, which aren't a thing here. My most memorable voting experience was last November, when Portland held its first ranked-choice election for mayor and city council. We had something like 120 candidates on the ballot, which made for far more work than usual, but I have never seen the city so politically engaged. It was the first election where I didn't encounter anyone who thought the result was predetermined by the money men downtown",3 favorites,['/favorited/2/8763667'],2025-09-09 12:26:00,Tuesday

I am sure I voted a split ticket — Democrat for Senate, Republican (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Morella) for House. The next election i imagine my Congressional votes were similar but I remember voting  (shudder) Nader for President. I was not very politically aware at the time, ignorant enough that I didn’t understand what was so egregious about the Supreme Court decision. I cared about my pet issues only, wasn’t impressed by Gore, and thought, well, how much damage could Bush do, really? Naive in just about every way. I have voted in (I believe) every election since, although not for every race (I’m not sure unopposed county court judges who didn’t bother to campaign at all need my seal of approval). It’s interesting, though, when we are willing to assign individual responsibility for jointly determined bad outcomes, and when we’re not. There’s an uptick of some kind of respiratory crud in my town, insofar as one can tell nowadays, and I’m the only person on my crowded bus wearing a mask. My bet is that even though masking in 2025 feels very much like tilting at windmills, this is probably a more impactful choice than most votes I’ve cast. I can mostly prevent myself from being a disease vector to others, which is small but isn’t nothing — a drop in the bucket in terms of overall risk, but it does shut off one path; there may be people who don’t get sick on a particular day because I cut off that path. My vote is a similarly small drop in the bucket — even smaller, perhaps, if we are thinking about statewide elections — but additionally there’s no real marginal benefit, except I guess the sociological benefit of being seen to vote. But I can’t, like, keep one person housed or fed or free with my most virtuous voting, even for one day.

The motivation for destroying so much of our (flawed though it may be) healthcare structure in the US may indeed be nihilistic vandalism, but there are plenty of enabler who say the government should turn almost everything over to private industry where it can be done “cheaper and more efficiently”.  I have never seen anyone actually explain how this will work with private industry doing the same job for less money while adding the cost of having to make a profit other than just yelling “WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE!” over and over.  Because as we all know there is none of that in the private sector (/s). A rare disease that is very relevant to me is a muscle disorder called Malignant Hyperthermia (https://www.mhaus.org/patients-and-families/learn-about-mh/) , a disease where all the skeletal muscles in the body contract uncontrollably in response to certain anesthetic drugs.  Left untreated it is over 90% fatal, and the best bet is to avoid triggering agents in affected patients.  Which of course requires an accurate diagnosis.  The gold standard test requires a sample of live muscle, which is then put through a precisely described sequence of tests (https://www.emhg.org/testing-for-mh/2017/12/28/in-vitro-contracture-testing-ivct) to determine susceptibility. Testing is difficult enough that there are currently only three places (https://www.mhaus.org/testing/muscle-biopsy-chct/chct-muscle-biopsy-testing-centers/) in North America (down from 5 a few years ago and in contrast to about 15 in Europe) that perform the testing, which must be done in person at the center. The barriers to testing are such that the only center available to US citizens has only done 136 (https://med.umn.edu/vhlab/clinical) tests since 1992.  There is work being done on genetic testing but it is not nearly as good. (I actually just lectured on this at a meeting and so could go on and on but won’t.)  The bottom line is that this sort of testing and the research needed to make it better is not going to be profitable enough for private industry to take it over and its existence depends on government support. An oft cited figure for the test I described is $5,000.00, but an expert I talked to said the true cost is probably closer to $30,000.00 when you take into consideration the expense of maintaining a specialized lab for the tests, travel expenses for the patients, and so on. Since it is a rare disease, there are probably only about 700 people affected by it in this country (although the true incidence isn’t known for sure), but repeat this for every rare, or even uncommon, disease out there and the health of many thousands, or tens of thousands, of people gets put at risk",22 favorites,"['https://www.mhaus.org/patients-and-families/learn-about-mh/', 'https://www.emhg.org/testing-for-mh/2017/12/28/in-vitro-contracture-testing-ivct', 'https://www.mhaus.org/testing/muscle-biopsy-chct/chct-muscle-biopsy-testing-centers/', 'https://med.umn.edu/vhlab/clinical', '/favorited/2/8761088']",2025-08-31 07:28:00,Sunday
https://www.metafilter.com/210168/Crisis-at-the-CDC,kliuless,https://www.metafilter.com/user/3217,"@ walkerbragman.bsky.social‬ (https://bsky.app/profile/walkerbragman.bsky.social/post/3lxhuv4lcic2s) : ""Just tried watching Ezra Klein's latest NYT podcast episode on how the U.S. got to this point where vaccines are so politicized. It's pretty clear that Klein and his guests—David Wallace Wells and Rachael Bedard—really do not understand why/how the political right turned on vaccines."" The COVID-19 pandemic undermined the right in several key ways: It showed us which workers are essential and empowered them. It showed that the markets can’t solve everything. It threatened GOP political prospects in a critical election. Government relief proved popular and effective If you’re the side of: capital interests wealth as an indicator of virtue/the value of one’s societal contributions free markets “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help’” ...you’re fucked. COVID just exposed you entirely. ‪ And if you don’t want anything to interfere with business, well, the only thing to do is end the crisis—at least the public’s perception that there is one. ‪ So we saw right-wing media and dark money groups start messaging out bullshit like: COVID is not really a huge deal Deaths are overcounted Best to pursue herd immunity through mass infection COVID mitigation measures are an assault on personal liberty School closures are irreparable harm. Now, on the surface, it doesn’t make sense for the right to oppose the COVID vaccines, right? They presented a way out of the pandemic. They were created through  Trump’s Operation Warp Speed. But logic doesn’t apply here. Pure politics do. ‪ See, Biden got to roll out the vaccines and claim that victory. Of course, the vaccines did not end the crisis immediately. They took a long time and Biden dropping nonpharmaceutical interventions meant a lot of people died on his watch. Undermining the vaccines meant undermining Biden and Dems. ‪ But that wasn’t all. Trump had pushed fake cures pre-vax. The people enlisted in that effort did not go away. Folks like Simone Gold of America’s Frontline Doctors, which pushed Trump’s fake hydroxychloroquine miracle COVID treatment. She ended up allying with anti-vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr... So we got the seeds for anti-vax bullshit on the right with the embrace of fake cures like hydroxychloroquine and later, ivermectin. Also, the herd immunity crowd is a natural ally for anti-vaxxers. Bc they said we didn’t need a vaccine for herd immunity, just infection So we start seeing anti-vaxxers in the comments sections of posts by folks like Jay Bhattacharya (https://bsky.app/profile/walkerbragman.bsky.social/post/3lqmqsdfwr22d) of the Great Barrington Declaration. And eventually, these folks whose real goal was undermining government and the pandemic response, embraced that audience. Taking a step back: The embrace of the unregulated wellness industry and anti-vax hokum was probably inevitable for the right. As the representative of big business interests, it has long had an antagonistic oppositional relationship with science and expertise. Think tobacco and climate science. ‪ With COVID vaccines, didn’t matter that Trump facilitated their production. It just mattered that they could be used to undermine the right’s favorite enemies: government Democrats public health authorities teachers and schools ...and appeal to their natural base: affluent whites While making inroads with new demographics in anyone skeptical of modern medicine and our healthcare system. Which, in this country, is a lot of fucking people. Our healthcare system breeds distrust. Millions don’t have a primary care doctor. Cost is prohibitive. Lack of access is another issue. ‪ Biden’s vaccine or test mandate was when we saw the growing alliance between anti-vax world and the political right to mainstream. The Defeat the Mandates rallies were really the start of MAHA before MAHA was actually a thing. ‪ The TL;DR here is that the mainstream political right came to embrace anti-vax bullshit because it helped undermine their favorite targets. Groups like Brownstone Institute and Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance acted as bridges to that world of Robert Kennedy Jr. But it was all politics. ‪ And I will also add that these efforts to politicize and undermine the government, public health authorities, and pandemic response were pretty successful. What should have been a catalyst for progressive change ended up serving the re-election of Donald Trump and the rise of anti-science cranks. ‪ Having covered this story in real-time through various pieces, it was weird watching each narrative become essential to the right—even as they contradicted each other. Like, the bio weapon/lab leak stuff that I didn’t get into in this thread directly contradicts the anti-vax and herd immunity stuff The right has like, a soup worldview. Anything goes in the pot so long as it erodes demand for and trust in government. Believe one part of it, you’ll eventually have to accept the others to stay relevant with the right. Even if it’s contradictory and the sum of the parts doesn’t make sense. ‪ Last thing: Adding to the inevitability of the herd immunity/anti-vax alliance, both camps (falsely) claim their views were suppressed by the powers that be. It adds a layer of conspiratorial appeal. And to be clear: I don’t normally watch Klein’s show. It was sent to me by a friend and colleague. ‪ I will also add that largely as a result of this right-wing ratfucking that helped reelect Trump, we never mounted a real COVID response. The virus is still circulating, killing, and disabling people. We never made necessary changes—like clean indoor air for workplaces and schools. We should tho. @ walkerbragman.bsky.social (https://bsky.app/profile/walkerbragman.bsky.social/post/3lxntxqnuqk2q) ‬: ""Fascism is all about elevating unqualified mediocrities to positions of power as a reward for loyalty.

https://www.metafilter.com/210168/Crisis-at-the-CDC,sotonohito,https://www.metafilter.com/user/17651,"RFK believes that illness is the universe punishing people for lack of virtue. If you are sick, in RFK's mind, then you are at fault. You should have eaten better, you should have exercised more, you should have prayed more, you shouldn't have had sex the wrong way, you shouldn't have thought bad thoughts, whatever. It's your fault. The obvious corollary to this is that being healthy is a symbol that you are a virtuous person. Anyone healthy must be virtuous. EXCEPT.... Medicine gets in the way of all that. Medicine is cheating. Medicine is, in their minds, moral/virtue welfare, it's giving people who didn't EARN health the benefit of health. It's giving those who deserve to be ill a way out without fixing their virtue problem. So of course he hates vaccines. And any other sort of healthcare that actually works (well, for us plebes anyway, he of course is virtuous by definition and therefore should get healthcare since for him it wouldn't be cheating). There's a Darwinist aspect as well, to RFK and his ilk if you die then it means you're weak and it is, therefore, good for your inferior genes to be eliminated so that the Übermensch like him can stride forward unencumbered by your icky plebian poor person inferiority. Note that no one ever asks RFK what is sin is? He's ill. He suffers from spasmodic dysphonia, clearly by his own logic this means he must be unvirtuous. He must have been eating wrong, or thinking bad thoughts, or having bad sex, or something that invited this illness into his life and since he still has the condition it means he hasn't stopped sinning and become virtuous. I'd give my left arm to see someone actually ask RFK why, if illness is the result of bad diet or lifestyle, what it is he did that was so wrong he was inflicted with spasmodic dysphonia. It wouldn't actually change anything of course, but it'd be funny to watch him get pissy. And, of course, there is definitely money to be had in quackery. If you don't have to bother with that inconvenient and expensive work of making sure your so called medicine actually does good then you can sell snake oil at a huge mark up! What bothers me is I don't see a way out. Trump et al got clever, notice how they're framing their destruction of the CDC as restoring real science and ending partisanship and ideological bias?

And just thinking about the right-wing division of that sentiment, if there's one thing you'd have to call it, is 100% sincere. Yeah, I have to second this. My partner has been following and organizing with health care workers to understand antivaxers for just about ten years now. They are 100% serious, and RFK is a true believer. All of this makes perfect sense from their perspective, and they are salivating to see the gains as what they see (incorrectly) the artificiality controlling and harming themselves and their families is washed away. You can't follow the money because the money isn't driving it. It's being driven by two groups: Nazis/eugenicists and antivax/wellness groups. And RFK is, by all accounts, an antivax true believer. He's not doing this to make a profit. He's genuinely this deluded about basic scientific reality. Antivaxers and similar health conspiracies see themselves (and often their children) as carrying unknown weaknesses susceptible to insult from environmental threats, and these threats are responsible for most of the significant conditions and disabilities they fear. (Autism is of course one of the most prominent of these; ADHD and mood disorders, cancer, chronic pain/fatigue, and obesity follow close behind.)The general mindset this creates is like a kind of orthorexia, except it's long since metastasized well past restricting itself to foodstuffs. That community is currently rioting against SPF and sunscreen, okay? They are fixated on what they see as purity of the natural self and preventing anything from potentially changing and corrupting that self, and they don't find it hard at all to add targets to their arsenal. They are frightened of things they don't understand, which is everything, and they seek a sense of control over their lives and often uncertain health by controlling their environment. Eugenecists and Nazis, by contrast, are okay with a certain degree of ""culling"" in service to the aim of breeding a new, superior strain of humans that are immune to current forms of suffering, and they are often completely okay with being found among the ""culled"" if that advances the greater vision. (At least, the true believers are, but I fully buy that the Christofascist and Nazi factions contain many people in this set.) They don't necessarily think they are already superior, they think that seizing control of human reproduction can get them there. For these people, allowing death, sometimes mass death, is just an unfortunate period to suffer through before reaching the genetic promised land.

I have my own thoughts, but since your partner has been studying it I'd be interested in their thoughts if you/they are willing to share? Their basic thought is that this is conspiratorial thinking, and conspiratorial thinking starts with a conclusion and then finds arguments to support that conclusion. They start with the target of their ire--and sometimes that target isn't inherently in line with right-wing orthodoxy! Large corporations (""Big Pharma,"" especially) are a common bogeyman in these circles. The problem is that any entity with perceived power can become that bogeyman, and the more that this entity is perceived as restricting someone's freedoms, the more likely that conspiracy theories settle onto that entity. The government makes a really nice roost for conspiracy theories, unfortunately. The most fertile ground for conspiracies is a person who is experiencing a lot of fear or free-floating anxiety for reasons they either a) don't understand or b) can't control. Conspiracy theories offer a rationale that makes the fear make ""sense"" to the person, and they usually also offer something that can be done about the fear by providing an amorphous enemy that can be opposed as a way to conquer the fear. That combination of understanding anxiety and having something to do about it is terribly, terribly comforting, and it can suck someone under like a riptide very easily if they're in a vulnerable place... like, say, a highly stressed out country where half is certain that the other half is about to murder them at any given moment. The thing you have to understand is that anti-vax thinking specifically is spread primarily by primary caregiving parents, and specifically it is mostly spread to recently postpartum new parents. (This is why my partner went into Labor and Delivery nursing, actually: they wanted to understand how to protect against anti-vax sentiments in this highly vulnerable population.) They want to underscore that vulnerability to this stuff isn't mediated by gender identity--trans people are also plenty susceptible--and that everyone on the political spectrum seems to be potentially vulnerable to this stuff, not just conservatives. Think about it as a virus of the mind. Immediately after giving birth, many people are sleep deprived, overwhelmed, filled with hormones, and newly filled with terror : some of it cognitive, and some of it hormonal, and all of it centered on the new baby they just evacuated from their own body. Sometimes that baby comes out in a context where they are terrified for the baby's survival, especially if the NICU is involved. (Fun fact: Most NICU babies are there relatively briefly while they grow big enough to fit safely in a car seat or need a little breathing support for a week or two because they inhaled meconium.) And there's nothing those parents can do to control their fears, and in the case of new gestational parents, their hormones are often creating massive anxiety well out of proportion to any actual risks. What do you even do about that? Spouse says, ""There is no way to say to somebody who is afraid that they have nothing to fear without them feeling like a foreign person is accusing them of lying. Even when we ask them 'what are you afraid of?,' instead of saying that there's nothing to be afraid of, often the anti-vaxer vultures have already swooped in and warned them that this is a trap. They tell mothers what our arguments are and how to argue against them. Did you know that the most common type of posting on an anti-vaxer forum is someone saying: Hey, so-and-so is telling me that vaccines are safe. How can I debunk their arguments? When new people enter these places, that's what they're greeted with immediately when they read a few new posts. They've already seen our arguments listed alongside a whole bunch of reasons that we're lying."" It doesn't help that most of the people pushing this genuinely do not understand what a chemical really is --or a toxin. For example, they do not understand the phrase ""the dose makes the poison."" No matter how much you explain, they won't believe you: they believe that if the dose makes the poison, then why would you take the risk of having any poison at all? The broader point that the world is composed of ""chemicals"" that all interact constantly with our bodies (also made of chemicals) is beyond them. When they do believe that there's a difference between chemicals that your body needs and chemicals that your body could be assaulted by, the vast majority of the time they believe that naturally occurring chemicals and synthetically created chemicals are fundamentally different even when they are molecularly identical. So your coal mine? Coal is natural! Gasoline, now. That's processed, so it must be more dangerous than coal. Sometimes they go so completely off grid to get away from the ""chemicals"" that they won't use soap on their children, since soap is a ""chemical."" Spouse has observed people talking about cleaning children with beef tallow instead, which is somehow more natural. (Yes, this makes no sense if you know how soap is made. They don't, and they won't learn.) Knowing a lot about how chemicals or toxins or vaccines work seems to be somewhat protective, but the real threshold is the level of anxiety/fear/paranoia the person is working with and the extent to which the conspiratorial idea provides them a comforting way to control and understand that fear. For that reason, no one is completely safe unless they feel safe, and who feels safe these days? If you want to read more about this, there are a number of good books on the subject. Paul Allen Offit has written several, including Deadly Choices: How the Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All and Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure . Spouse also recommends Brian Deer's The Doctor Who Fooled the World: Science, Deception, and the War on Vaccines ",70 favorites,['/favorited/2/8761175'],2025-08-31 15:58:00,Sunday

It’s been a while since I read Marx, I remember appreciating the analysis of capital. As a project, I’m down on communism for two evergreen reasons and one new one. 1) People can’t help but be selfish, some more than others, and there will always be a tendency for power of any kind to corrupt. I accept that we’re malleable culturally, to even a great extent, but we’re still primates. This obviously showed itself all over Eastern Europe and anywhere else it’s been tried. You can no true Scotsman this if you want but ehhhh. We have these tendencies and should accept that. 2) Ethnos is a massively affective pull, it just is, and it’s more powerful than class affiliation, which is fine for discrete projects - and that’s maybe how and where energy should be focused. International class based movements I think are best suited to discrete goals, as k3ninho said, because I don’t see them having deep enough roots to motivate people long term. I’ve recently become aware of Laclau and Mouffe and what I understood from them about shifting, goal based, emotionally alliances was super interesting 3) social media has fucked everything so profoundly. Some young people are veering left, others into the manosphere… not to mention the conspiracy theorists and status quo justifiers. Polarization/silos = a terrifying problem, we can’t agree on basic facts.

https://www.metafilter.com/210156/Theres-still-no-shaking-the-philosopher,jamjam,https://www.metafilter.com/user/32678,"What we call 'nonstandard analysis' was how Newton did it when he invented calculus fwiw this is so zoomed-out a way to put it as to basically be not true --- the Newton fetish undermined mathematics in Britain largely because of a disdain for rigour, while the point of nonstandard analysis, which is totally mainstream modern rigorous maths, is that it's a way to put things like infinitesimals on a firm footing in exactly the way that the ""Newtonian attitude"" tended to ignore. in fairness, the same might well apply to Marx, who wasn't even familiar with analysis as it was played in his time, and maybe anticipated NA in only the same limited sense that Newton and the other loosey-goosey infinitesimal users did. The tools Abraham Robinson used to put infinitesimals on a firm footing, namely a theorem in predicate logic proved by Gödel and a 1934 construction by Norwegian mathematician Thoralf Skolem (https://www.britannica.com/topic/Infinitesimals-1368274) , were not available to Newton or any other mathematician for the next couple of centuries, so I think it’s ludicrous to attack Newton and his followers for a lack of rigor: Hence, infinitesimals do not exist among the real numbers. This does not prevent other mathematical objects from behaving like infinitesimals, and mathematical logicians of the 1920s and ’30s actually showed how such objects could be constructed. One way to do this is to use a theorem about predicate logic proved by Kurt Gödel in 1930. All of mathematics can be expressed in predicate logic, and Gödel showed that this logic has the following remarkable property: A set Σ of sentences has a model [that is, an interpretation that makes it true] if any finite subset of Σ has a model. This theorem may be used to construct infinitesimals as follows. First, consider the axioms of arithmetic, together with the following infinite set of sentences (expressible in predicate logic) that say “ι is an infinitesimal”: [refer to the article for the formula] Any finite subset of these sentences has a model. For example, say the last sentence in the subset is “ι < 1/n”; then the subset can be satisfied by interpreting ι as 1/(n + 1). It then follows from Gödel’s property that the whole set has a model; that is, ι is an actual mathematical object. The infinitesimal ι cannot be a real number, of course, but it can be something like an infinite decreasing sequence. In 1934 the Norwegian Thoralf Skolem gave an explicit construction of what is now called a nonstandard model of arithmetic, containing “infinite numbers” and infinitesimals, each of which is a certain class of infinite sequences. And far from dismissing Newton's  work on infinitesimals as ""loosey-goosey"" Robinson showed he was on the right track to a degree I think is surprising: In the 1960s the German-born American Abraham Robinson similarly used nonstandard models of analysis to create a setting where the nonrigorous infinitesimal arguments of early calculus could be rehabilitated. He found that the old arguments could always be justified, usually with less trouble than the standard justifications with limits. He also found infinitesimals useful in modern analysis and proved some new results with their help. Quite a few mathematicians have converted to Robinson’s infinitesimals, but for the majority they remain “nonstandard.” Their advantages are offset by their entanglement with mathematical logic, which discourages many analysts",2 favorites,"['https://www.britannica.com/topic/Infinitesimals-1368274', '/favorited/2/8761518']",2025-09-01 22:20:00,Monday

Newton was aware that his use of infinitesimals in various places was informal, and tried to avoid infinitesimals in method of fluxions ; IIRC, he defines derivatives the usual way as a limit, except he's not really working with a precise formulation of the definition of a limit, which comes later.  the alternate approach with limits is the one that became formalised first and therefore gets to be ""standard"". the 17th-century people had some useful intuitions about infinitesimals, and knew a bunch of arguments one would be able to make if one had infinitesimals available, but Newton wasn't writing real proofs with infinitesimals and wasn't claiming to be.  the additional tools needed to do that are totally unlike anything available in the 17th-century, and rely on huge amounts of work that happened between Newton and Robinson's times, which it's worth not sweeping under the carpet. (i mentioned ultrafilters because they're needed for one of the ways of actually constructing the hyperreals; anything you do to 'make infinitesimals work' is going to need something conceptually major and alien-for-Newton's-time like that, and those things are no less important than the earlier intuitive arguments that correctly identified clarifying or avoiding infinitesimals as an important problem.) a correct intuition that can, with additional tools, be developed into an actual proof is not the same as an actual proof, which is all i meant by ""loosey-goosey"".  that's meant neutrally, the way mathematicians often use ""handwaving"", to describe a situation where there's an argument that's incomplete, or informal, or heuristic, or genuinely but fixably wrong, which is exactly the situation described in the last thing you quoted. anyway, nonstandard methods are indeed super-useful and they do indeed enable one to think about certain things in a more, like, fluid way, without having so much of the formal bookkeeping so front-and-centre (for me, this is important when using asymptotic cones, but it comes up for many people in many contexts; you mentioned Tao, who has some great blog posts about it). but it certainly isn't for free, and i just think Robinson's giving the usual 17th-century suspects an amount of credit that elides how much goes into making the sorts of arguments they wanted to make into actual arguments (and, probably, being a bit modest about his own role)",4 favorites,['/favorited/2/8762135'],2025-09-03 14:06:00,Wednesday

Yes; modern standards of rigor are insanely higher than back then. Math in my mind is at least 5ish things 1. Notation, the scribbles on paper 2. Tricks that ""work"", at least usually, ideally always (""cancel like terms"" etc) 3. A connection to something real that the math models 4. A culture of understanding what is going on by users 5. An underlying rigor formalization that makes it really likely to be consistent This is why you can pick up Calculus and replace its foundations (5) and still get Calculus (as 1-4 remain intact).  Or you can take polynomials (1-2, 5) and use their terms and exponents to count combinations of things. NSA vs SA is mostly about 5; 4 is impacted a bit (in that we sometimes teach the epsilon definition in an attempt to get people to understand Calculus; but I honestly don't think it works). ""Calculus"" works because we attach it to real life stuff that doesn't have to get infinitely small, but gets close enough that our infinitely small Calculus mostly works (3) (see Planck length); the parts of Calculus where ""very very very small"" and ""infinitely small"" disagree don't correspond to the reality we attach Calculus to! Rotating back to Marx, his construct is a response to a very different capitalism than today, and his deconstruction and vision of a replacement seem very limited by that.  But invent a utopia and you get followers I guess. I have seen post-Marxist criticisms of the modern economy that seem far less hamstrung than Marx (no fault of his); like, how wealth distribution in a completely random ""unfair"" capitalistic model looks thermodynamic (as in, the distribution of gas particle speeds), and matches what we see in modern capitalism with regards to wealth.

I think that's probably just capitalism with less-exploited workers (still an improvement!), but increases in x are concrete progress toward a socialist situation that eventuates at x=100.  the y is needed to help that happen, contend the people who advocate this, and the rest just reflects the capitalist place we either started with or needed to build first for reasons like: you need capital to start a factory and capitalists are who have it right now.  this is a simplification but it illustrates that there's nothing particularly utopian about building socialism, including according to Marx and Marxists.) one thing that lots of people, including but not limited to Marxists, find tedious about those of us raised in broadly liberal traditions, is that we elevate beliefs to the same status as facts a lot, leading to sentences that start ""to me..."", followed by a basically factually testable assertion that isn't actually a subjective matter.

The original is an opinion piece in the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/07/texas-gerrymandering-democrats-nuclear-cold-war/) , and I can't read it, myself, but I appreciated the E-V summary: The 15 states where the Democrats have the trifecta are economically much stronger than the 23 states where the Republicans have the trifecta. The strategy here is to (threaten to) use that power to force the red states to cut it out. For example, blue states could make it more difficult for big corporations to operate in red states. Laws could be passed forbidding blue state pension funds from buying stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds containing companies headquartered in ""Bad States,"" where the governor would maintain the list of ""Bad States"" and could update it as needed. This means no AT&T, American Airlines, ExxonMobil, Phillips 66, and more. Selling off that stock would depress the prices. Further, when the state put out a tender to have companies bid on a contract, state agencies would be banned from buying anything from a company on the Bad State list unless there was no alternative. That means no more Dell computers (headquartered in Round Rock, TX) but good news for HP in Palo Alto. Also no more Teslas (Austin), which would be good news for General Motors and Ford (in Michigan). Going a step further, all state contracts, also for services, with Bad State companies would be banned. The next level would be poaching key personnel. California, Illinois, New York, etc. could offer substantial relocation bonuses for doctors, nurses, teachers and other valued professionals to relocate to their states if they settled in areas that are currently underserved. ... They conclude, The states, or better yet, a compact among the 15 blue-trifecta states, could be a countervailing force. A credible threat to use federalism to pit the massive economies of the blue states against the largely agricultural economies of the red states could be a game changer if done right. I dislike punitive measures against entire states; lots of active progressives live in every state. I would rather find ways to build solidarity and unity with my sisters and brothers across the country.

Black-balling a company based on where its headquarters are located (red state) severely harms the workforce based elsewhere, like the 22,000 employees at Tesla’s Freemont, CA factory, for instance. There’s also the very real problem of most states (but especially California) being home to several active-duty military bases, which would pose a very real threat to any state government actively monkeywrenching the flow of tax dollars into Trump’s pocket. It all seems like a semi-moot point, though, given that crippling the federal government is more-or-less the entire raison d’être of the Trump administration, anyway. I doubt they’d give a damn about states going down this path (save for the fact that it would affect the flow of cash into Trump’s pockets) and it would give TrumpCo a target on which to blame the collapse of the government.

Even a little hope in that direction is something right now, maybe more than I realized. I don't like the suggestion to drain medical talent from red states by ending reciprocal licensing agreements with those states, though. That seems like something that would potentially cause a lot of harm to red-state residents, especially those who are looking for options for, say, gender-affirming care or reproductive health care outside their states. Right now, if their doctor can practice in multiple states, they could feasibly have greater continuity of care by working with the same doctors in another state (yes, that mobility might be criminalized in their home state, but that's a separate problem). Also, not everyone can move, either quickly or at all, and people will still have health-care needs in those states, even if seeking care for their actual needs is criminalized. It doesn't seem ethical to further reduce their options for care. Same goes for, say, reciprocal teacher licensing agreements—even if teachers in red states are hamstrung by the law in terms of what they can teach and what books they can use, that doesn't make teachers any less necessary. Arguably it makes keeping discerning teachers in red states more important, if we care about people as people and not just pawns. There are probably other reciprocal agreements whose suspension could be explored, though, that might be beneficial to the general public in blue states. As per the fugitive slave laws example, not enforcing warrants from red states or the federal government for crimes that aren't recognized in blue states, and not supporting any related enforcement efforts, could be a good place to start.

Problem is that the Supreme Court keeps kneecapping lesser courts in their ability to enforce their rulings, and that's when they don't just outright say Trump can do whatever he wants.

And all that is when Trump doesn't get to slow walk things so that the lawsuit will be settled decades from now and in the meantime he can do whatever he wants.

https://www.metafilter.com/210089/Soft-Secession-and-Economic-Deportation-of-Red-States-DL-substack,limeonaire,https://www.metafilter.com/user/28036,"> That seems like something that would potentially cause a lot of harm to red-state residents This is such a sweet, stupid, misguided thought I want to hug you and shake you in equal measure. Are you not able to recognize a civil war? Do you not see them sending armed troops to occupy and suppress my state, to kidnap and disappear my neighbors? What else would you call this armed occupation? What is this occupying army then, this new confederacy of red states, if not my enemy? Oh come on. They're doing it in my state and my home state too. I'm acutely aware of that. I'm also afraid for my friends and neighbors. That doesn't mean I have to agree that it's justified to further deprive people in red states—like my friends and family with serious medical needs, and like many teachers I know—of access to adequate medical care or education or licensing. Again: Not everyone can just up and move. There are lots of other levers that can be pulled before cutting reciprocal licensing agreements. I think the way you talk about red states as uniformly your enemy is foolish. I refuse to surrender my compassion. What red states are is often dramatically gerrymandered—if the people there actually had adequate representation in districts that weren't totally skewed by redistricting, those states would also be blue or purple. That's why national and state Republicans are doing everything they can to gerrymander those states even further, to make it even harder to change that lack of representation in any meaningful way on any kind of timeline that could boost progressive prospects in the next election. Like OK, so why are reciprocal licensing agreements a line in the sand for me? Well, for one thing, it's just another way of treating people in ""red"" states like they live in some backwater that's not important to support. It's another way of cutting off lifelines for people who are very real and not hypothetical and are still going to need care. And I guess to me, it's also a form of surrendering to the chaos that's already being inflicted by people who don't care about the other people in their own states or see them as human. Inasmuch as the whole ""they go low, we go high"" rhetoric now sounds like it's misguided advice from another era, and I agree with the overall premise of these posts that it's time that our governors matched some of what Republicans are doing with similar measures, I don't think it's a good move to surrender our personal, individual compassion. We would do well to have some nuance in our thought process. One reason ""blue"" states are doing well is because they have compassion and support better quality of life and more opportunities. In part, that's because they can afford to have more compassion. But these things become self-reinforcing—libertarian leadership in ""red"" states helps ensure that those states don't have enough money in their coffers, and those conditions of scarcity plus evangelical end-times morality (which negatively affects health care and education) keep people stuck in situations they shouldn't have to endure. Would you not offer medical care to refugees and hostages? Because the people stuck in ""red"" states who don't agree with ""red"" values or morality are more akin to refugees and hostages than enemy combatants. I understand the power of BDS, but I wouldn't say that people in places whose products I'm otherwise boycotting are undeserving of quality medical care and education. I support everyone's human rights. I don't support profiting off of removing the human rights of others. Perhaps there is no going back on some of this—perhaps it's true that as an article I read earlier this week suggested, many of us are just fawning or freezing in response to these terrifying situations we can't personally control, just hoping that someone can land the plane of state safely without everything crashing, but that the plane is indeed very likely to crash. I don't know. I have hope that people are closely tracking all the government resources and agencies that are being wrecked, dismantled, tampered with, or adulterated in some way (like websites) so they can be put back together in a better future. I know we likely don't even know the extent of what's been wrecked yet (e.g., whatever happened with DOGE) or has yet to be wrecked. There's a lot that needs to be done.

In Europe, we're frequently stuck in 1/3rd-ish hard-ish left, 1/3rd-ish far-right, and 1/3rd-ish neo-liberal center-right.  We typically have the neo-liberal center-right holding power through repeated dirty tricks, which makes everyone think the left could hold power. I'm thus pretty dubious our lefts could field enough support to hold power long though, not unless they take support away from the far-right, like by becoming moderately anti-immigration ala Pim Fortuyn.  It's more likely our far-rights copy left-ish policies and take support away from the left, well think ""national socialism"" here, but they're slowed down by their own corruption, buisness interests, etc. It's quite different in the US because of the two big tent parties, but I suspect neo-liberal Democrats believe something similar holds under the hood, except they foresee center-right Democrats flocking into Trump's arms, over their own financial interests. It's still true Democrats should ""fall in line behind the left"" , because Democrats have no other play here, but the short-term odds look questionable, both of them doing so, and of it working out. As for real optimism.. Trump has pushed hard for war against Venezuela (https://www.twz.com/sea/u-s-navy-destroyers-submarine-amphibious-ships-being-sent-toward-venezuela) , presumably to steal their oil.  As always TACO remains likely, but several joint chiefs resigned, probably over this (https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/18/air-force-chief-alvinn-steps-down-00513612?nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&nname=politico-toplines&nrid=0000015f-2c25-d72c-ad7f-ecaffb350000) , so it likely looks serious internally. If Trump starts a war, and if China supports Venezuela with drones, and if Venezuela can take out American oil refineries, then hopefully Trump's war could turn into another Vietnam. If so, this creates a real opportunity for something new.  Or neo-liberals to resume control and prepare the field for the next Trump.  Or Americans become so deperate for fuel they embrace another Vietnam or ten.

They control nothing. Not the House. Not the Senate. Not the Supreme Court. No part of the executive branch. They lost. If we wanted them to exercise power, we needed to get more of them elected. You're not wrong that the options for elected Democrats are very much more limited than they were when they held control of any part of the federal government and you're definitely not wrong about the need for popular resistance.  And I will stipulate in advance that many people (not necessarily MeFites, but in general) who are now demanding action from Democratic leaders are not approaching the situation realistically, but.. Still, I think you're much too ready to let Democrats off the hook for their terrible lack of leadership in the current situation.  It's true that they no longer directly control the levers of power at the federal level but they are still in control of many resources that could be and should be used to resist, including (but not limited to): hundreds of millions of dollars and the means to raise more national level name recognition and credibility on political issues mailing lists and communications apparatus capable of outreach to tens of millions of Americans a small army of full-time professional political organizers and strategists personal and professional connections and alliances with influential individuals throughout the nation and the world thousands of members with knowledge and with experience serving at every level of government etc, etc.. I could go on, but do I need to? There are some individuals making some efforts, but as far as I can see, at the national party level they're providing no realistic framework around which resistance could organize but neither are they ready to step aside and let someone or something else assume that role.  The Democratic Party is in real danger of becoming (if it hasn't already) one of the biggest obstacles to the popular resistance for which you advocate. If they're not going to effectively lead, haven't signaled any significant willingness to follow, and are definitely not getting out of the way then do you really find it hard to understand people's frustration with them? And that's not even touching on the issue that when they did have literal billions at their command as well as access to all of the powers of the executive branch, they failed spectacularly to develop any effective contingency plans to significantly slow down what's happening now.  At the very least they had half a year before the election where polls put the outcome within the margin of error and then another several months after the election and before the inauguration.  But that's a whole extra argument..

Cuomo hopes Trump will help him beat Mamdani (https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/19/cuomo-mamdani-trump-new-york-00514408) [Politico] Publicly, Cuomo — a Democrat and the former governor of New York — has shunned the idea of getting any help from Trump. Cuomo said he’d decline an endorsement, and denied a New York Times report that he’d spoken with the president about the race. But Cuomo seemed hopeful for the president’s help behind closed doors, speaking to the more Trump-friendly crowd gathered at media mogul Jimmy Finkelstein’s home in Southampton — the ultra-wealthy Long Island enclave 80 miles east of New York City. Another co-host of the fundraiser, former New York City Council President Andrew Stein, told the Times he briefed Trump last month on how Cuomo had the best chance to beat Mamdani in the general election. And Trump may be receptive, Stein suggested to the publication. The president’s heart is still with New York, and “he doesn’t want a communist and socialist running the city.” Cuomo took questions at the event, and an attendee asked Cuomo directly if he or his team was in conversation with the White House about how Trump might influence the race. Cuomo didn’t directly deny it this time. “Let’s put it this way: I knew the president very well,” Cuomo responded. “I believe there’s a big piece of him that actually wants redemption in New York. He feels that he was rejected by New York. We voted for Hillary Clinton. Bill de Blasio took his name off things. So I believe there will be opportunities to actually cooperate with him. I also believe that he’s not going to want to fight with me in New York if he can avoid it.” Please explain to the unenlightened why 'vichy democrat' isn't the correct description of what Cuomo is doing here?",1 favorite,"['https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/19/cuomo-mamdani-trump-new-york-00514408', '/favorited/2/8759107']",2025-08-25 05:41:00,Monday

https://www.metafilter.com/210027/Poopcase,JHarris,https://www.metafilter.com/user/23306,"gauche 's Foreign Policy link is the most useful thing i see here. It's not that all this... information... is being collected, but that it's really questionable how useful it is. It mentions a gambler's fallacy that, up to a point, collecting more information on horse races doesn't increase your odds of winning, but it does make you more confident, and thus often falsely. So why is this done if it's not really useful? The term I've come up with is narrative capture . Why do intelligence agencies believe false things when they have so much secret information? Why have rich tech people gone all in on ""AI?"" Why to libertarian types obsess over cryptocurrency? Why do really poor people vote red? Why do most people fall into line when pushed on their social group's beliefs? Peer pressure is one form of narrative capture, and it can be pervasive. People tend to trust and listen mostly to people like them, whether they're investors, generally rich people, spooks or the impoverished, and it's really hard to avoid falling into that. So I think that collecting the literal poop on leaders, and zealously guarding that of your own, is probably one of those things that intelligence agencies have grown to just doo. (sorry) But take a moment to think about the process. Is part of being elected President the experience of always having to shit in a bag? Or do they have some on-the-outs flunky reliably follow the Big Cheese and, whenever they emerge from the Smallest Room in the House, follow them with a little green bag, like cleaning up after a dog? And consider your own experiences with poop: it's often hard to get absolutely all of it! Do they get all the toilet water too? All the used tissue? What if there was a bidet? What if they had the runs? Let's not even get into what happens to all that collected feces, presumably it gets shunted into The Brownest File. The considerable logistical challenges of complete fecal collection make me start to doubt those many stories. What they're planted, to add to the mystique of a nation's intelligence, to add to the legend of its efficiency? What if stories of shit collecting is, itself, an op? Like, a po-op?

The whole idea selling Bitcoin was its diminishing minting of blocks that simulated the mining of a geologically-limited supply of gold, and how this made it at least as good as gold but without any government regulation. Around ten years ago, I received a lecture from a banker about why Bitcoin was doomed to fail: Bitcoin is backed by nothing, unlike the US dollar which is backed by gold. This should be startling news to anyone paying attention since the US dollar hasn't been backed by gold since 1971, but we should see the truth in the sentiment anyway. The value of the US dollar is orchestrated by the American government and backed by its overwhelming outstanding national debt and its 877 military bases. Money is debt. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REbrKOjsG2A) Ask any cryptocurrency investor ""why the hell would anybody want this?"" and you're bound to get the Tupperware sales pitch non-sequitur, but if you prod them enough about their personal motivations then you'll find it's only about getting rich by being ahead of the curve. And that's never going to work when that's the only reason why anybody gets 'in' on a speculative investment. Everyone involved is always looking to cash out. Why is this not so for gold and silver? Well, it seems like the answer is generally that, between two parties, one side has more of it than they'll ever have any use for and they've found a way to leverage that to make demands of the other. The government prints money and asks you for it back in taxes. Why? The government doesn't want your money. They want you to do things for them. Money is simply a quantifiable unit for one to make demands of another. We live in a colonial world of metastasized personal interest where everybody you will ever meet in public life wants something from you and everybody who wants to give you something is probably trying to exploit you. If this is not the world you want to live in then you have a moral imperative to reject this system. Not all at once, but little by little.

It lived on myspace, blogs, and agregator sites like hypemachine. In a meta sense, a lot of really iconic dj mixes were also entirely debuted and discussed on blogs . Basically all of these blogs are gone, and the aggregator or meta discussion sites, forums, etc are either in busted states of disrepair or gone as well. These mixes(like this (https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra171-erol-alkan) , or this (https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra173-modeselektor) , or this (https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra053-riton) , or this (https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra074-prins-thomas) , or this (https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra098-todd-terje) , or this (https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra114-aeroplane) .

Buckley wanted to pretend to be the aristocratic, urbane, civilized voice of a reasonable and proper conservatism. But at heart all conservatism is just raging emotion shrieking that anyone different is evil because they're different. And Buckley was joined by the white liberal people of his era in the pretense that he was a civilized, urbane, erudite conservative, the sort of reasonable and rational opponent they could debate in a civilized way and justify their belief that white conservatives weren't really all that bad. I think it's clear from his demeanor and arguments during his debate with Buckley that Sidney Poitier, like I would assume most people who aren't white, saw the veil of propriety and civilization Buckley tried to draw over his bigotry and monarchist beliefs for the bullshit it was. He was a man who tried desperately to pretend conservatism wasn't, at heart, mere bigotry and aristocracy dressed up as something better, and the worst thing about his life is that so many white liberals collaborated with him in the pretense. The apologia for Why the South Must Prevail, the palpable relief when Buckley weasel worded his way through a sham of walking back his position, reveal the intense discomfort white liberals have with acknowledging that any white conservative who makes even the slightest gesture towards pretending they aren't racist is actually racist. He was a racist. He was an antisemite. He was a misogynist. He was homophobic. He was elitist, classist, and aristocratic. He was, in short, all the things that conservatives always are.

The US has never been less questioned as the military and foreign policy hegemon than it is today. The tight control over media feeds, algorithms, and the floods of propaganda are clearly working; I'd been wondering who the target audience was; clearly its internally focused on the domestic market to perpetuate the exceptionalism narrative while entire structures crumble around you. I also just finished reading a lovely book on Seneca's last 15 years which ends with Caeser's assassination and the fall of the Republic (with Octavian as the next Emperor). I also push back at kliuless' response (https://www.metafilter.com/209813/GZERO-Minus-One-Bedrock-Below-Foundation#8752354) which is crafted on a foundation of analysis (of China) which is itself filtered by the Koolaid mentioned above. That is, the insularity of the American epistemological infrastructure is such that its analysis tends to get skewed by its own filter bubble. And, assumptions are projected on to the behaviours of alleged Others based on the one's own default responses and behaviours. However, if we consider that the world does not operate or think like an American, then a) we cannot assume that a China (or all of BRICS) will either behave or react the way an American would, and b) that the main premise of DeLong's argument is incorrect (given that American worldview is filtered by American koolaid). This is an epistemological blindspot tbh. Never does anyone pause to consider that perhaps nobody wants to be a hegemon the way the US wants to be a hegemon. Others think differently, and operate with a very different epistemological infrastructure (forthcoming). Looking at the situation from the outside of the American worldview filter bubble and koolaid conditioning, DeLong is simply summarizing what has increasingly become obvious ever since January 21 2025. The first frantic push by the current US administration created a massive systemic shock as the rapid fire 'global structural adjustment program' (SAPs, my name for it borrowed from what the IMF etc did to Africa in the 1980s & 1990s) was launched. However, over the past 2 months or so, it has become clear that beyond the first rush to destroy and dismantle, there is no further strategy. Which is why now we simply get Pumpkinhead micro-aggressing every Other who 'dares to defy' him. Interestingly, 'defiance' has itself become a popular word in English language news media to refer to any country or its leader who does not immediately grovel and kiss the american Emperor's ass. (do a search, the evidence is there). One example is 50% tariffs on Brazil because they are taking Bolsanaro to court; plus US sanctions on the Brazilian judge. What kind of foreign policy is this? The rest of the world is not blind nor ignorant of statesmanship and policymaking. Random countries cannot simply sanction you for following your own laws on corruption. These are all petty micro-aggressions by a fake hegemon. These signals indicate taht even the Americans have figured out that their hegemony is now fake and fragile. More as I consider other evidence and points. But my main point stands, do not analyse a China based on your own idea of what you would do. We are none of us Americans and have not drunk your koolaid. We operate from a plurality of knowledge systems. *we here simply refers to the mostly invisible Other, the majority world that Americans call (ugh) 'people of color'",6 favorites,"['https://www.metafilter.com/209813/GZERO-Minus-One-Bedrock-Below-Foundation#8752354', '/favorited/2/8752360']",2025-08-03 01:17:00,Sunday

Domestic dysfunction, foreign policy vacillation, and the willful neglect of alliances are now swiftly undermining American influence, credibility , and leadership. - quote from the OP (https://archive.ph/w7ERQ) Let's look at credibility. A pattern that has emerged over these past 6 months is a loud and noisy claim made by Trump on something he has done or achieved on the world stage, disseminated immediately by the narrative campaign pushers to every ""the West"" publication. This is immediately followed by the subject of this false claim pushing back loudly that whatever Trump is claiming is not true, didn't happen, he's making shit up. But because they are stuck with their own publications, which aren't as pervasive and powerful as Trump's publications + the internet's algorithms all kiss Trump's ass; we never see their version of the story. I've seen this with China's first trade talks (Trump claimed to be talking; China said WTF? we're not talking yet); India's ceasefire with Pakistan (Trump claimed to broker the deal; India said WTF dude you weren't involved); and most recently with claims of umpteen millions to Gaza which now the WSJ themselves debunk. That is, there is a clear pattern of lies and attempts to hijack the narrative. Second pattern that emerges particularly in the last 4 months or so (because it took them their first couple of months to begin getting out to other countries) is that its the headlines themselves which Trump and his immediate goon squad (Rubio in particular) care about. There is less and less evidence of any policy changes or follow up actions after teh first blast of the grand narrative in the headlines... that is, its the PR of the policy that is increasingly more important for the Americans to achieve than the actual policy itself. An example is the umpteen different allegedly successful trade deals announced, most of which are followed up by much less visible articles pointing out that 'the details are yet to be worked out' but 'promises have been made'... Soon enough, you'll get a pattern of promises being made for the joy of the PR which gets the bully off your neck so you can breathe, knowing you never need to follow up and make good because a) they don't care, and b) they'll never remember.

https://www.metafilter.com/209813/GZERO-Minus-One-Bedrock-Below-Foundation,coolname,https://www.metafilter.com/user/197611,"I read the article (https://www.metafilter.com/209813/GZERO-Minus-One-Bedrock-Below-Foundation#8752369) in its entirety and agreed for the most part with its analysis of U.S. hegemony embodied in the Washington Consensus and the violence and meddling that the U.S. has done abroad to uphold it. I also agree with your analysis of how US-biased coverage of world events serves to normalize and invisibilize its self-serving policies. But I took exception with its characterization of the roots of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine: In the mid-1990s, the Clinton Administration began pushing for NATO to expand Eastwards.  The first round of enlargement took place in 1999 and brought in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland.  The second occurred in 2004; it included Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.  Moscow complained bitterly from the start but was too weak to do anything more. According to the prevailing wisdom in the West, the Ukraine crisis can be blamed almost entirely on Russian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin, the argument goes, annexed Crimea out of a long-standing desire to resuscitate the Soviet empire. But this account is wrong: the United States and its European allies share most of the responsibility for the crisis.  The taproot of the trouble is NATO enlargement, the central element of a larger strategy to move Ukraine out of Russia’s orbit and integrate it into the West.  For Putin, the illegal overthrow of Ukraine’s democratically elected and pro-Russian president—which he rightly labeled a “coup”—was the final straw.  He responded by taking Crimea, a peninsula he feared would host a NATO naval base. I think two things can be true simultaneously. American foreign policy around the turn of the 21st century was run by Cold Warrior neocons still focused on Russia as the primary threat, who also wanted to bring more resources, human and otherwise, into the global system that ultimately most benefits the U.S. (and most benefits those at the top of its plutocracy) and didn't care about the ultimately destabilizing effects this would have on the region (e.g., imagine if Russia was prevented from descending into gangland anarchy?). At the same time, to minimize and excuse Russia's barely-covert then overt invasion of its sovereign neighbor and to misleadingly characterize Yanukovich as 'democratically-elected' given probable election manipulation is beyond the pale. Moreover, there is a myopia here about the agency of nations other than the U.S. and Russia. Did these Eastern European countries not have historical reasons to fear Russian domination and would rationally choose the protective umbrella of a different, more distant hegemon? Did the Ukrainian people not have a right to choose its own leader in a fair election? For what it's worth I think that a breakdown of the hegemonic system, where more people in more places all across the globe are able to have a bigger say in the way their lives are governed and structured, is a step in the right direction given my anarchist political predispositions. Whether the world will go far enough, where everyone's circle of empathy ultimately does encompass everyone and there are not only freedoms-to but equally important freedoms-from want, fear, abuse, etc., or whether there is too inborn in too many a desire for domination, status, and self-benefit for that to ever be possible, well, that will remain to be seen",7 favorites,"['https://www.metafilter.com/209813/GZERO-Minus-One-Bedrock-Below-Foundation#8752369', '/favorited/2/8752427']",2025-08-03 07:42:00,Sunday

The loss of global public goods to humanity from these myopic and misguided US actions involves much more than may be immediately apparent in the accumulating effect of the tariffs as taxes on trade."" The flagrant violations of international law in the imposition of the tariffs are so numerous that few bother even to mention them anymore. Who continues to point out that these arbitrary actions by the United States are inconsistent with the basic laws of nondiscrimination that are supposed to guide and govern world trade under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO)? Brazil and some other countries are seeking consultations on these illegal tariffs in WTO dispute settlement, but is it even certain that the United States will bother to show up in the Geneva legal proceedings? A request for consultations on a trade dispute must be heeded under WTO rules, but does that still matter? [...] In all the accounts of how country after country has bowed to the bullying of the United States on bilateral trade, what is missing most is any real comprehension of the larger cost to the cooperation vital to civilization, which comes from the willful departure, without any justifiable reason, of the long-agreed understanding of how nations are supposed to behave in maintaining some semblance of a world economic order. For more than three-quarters of a century since the aftermath of World War II, international economic confrontation was minimized because there was agreement on a certain order of behavior in trade. This code of behavior has now been thoughtlessly discarded by the very country that did the most to put it in place. It is not only the rules that have been cast aside; abandoned, too, are the norms that have helped hold the rules in place throughout eight difficult decades. The complexity of civilization depends on rules, but it also depends on expectations of behavior, by individuals and countries, in framing and finding means of human cooperation in a world where interests and aspirations vary widely among countries. Political actors—as the theorists call them—are supposed to act in certain rational ways. They are not supposed to act arbitrarily, motivated, as some of the current US trade policies seem to be, merely by impulsive personal whim. This has happened before, in a time of world crisis a century ago. In his unfinished novel, The Man Without Qualities , the 20th-century Austrian writer Robert Musil wrote of the decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the First World War: “However well founded an order may be, it always rests in part on a voluntary faith in it … once this unaccountable and uninsurable faith is used up, the collapse soon follows: epochs and empires crumble no differently from business concerns when they lose their credit.” Hence the guns of August that signaled the collapse of a previous attempt by humanity at civilized cooperation and left 40 million people dead worldwide. It is the rules and norms that were ultimately instituted after a second such global conflict to help prevent a third conflagration that are now being ignored. Where is the voluntary faith that remains in the postwar international order, in trade and elsewhere? Not without reason, the first rule of public international law is that international agreements must be followed in good faith. But if there is no good faith, if there is only autocratic caprice, if there is only strong-arm intimidation, then where is the hope for agreement based on anything but force? The new Trump trade “agreements” are instruments of coercion, not cooperation. The “reciprocal” Trump tariffs are more of the same. For the most part, they exist only as fleeting expressions of presidential grievance, subject to alteration at any moment and for any reason, however specious or irrational. The new world order in trade is the absence of order. It is international chaos. It is one man’s whim of the moment, worth nothing, signifying nothing, subject at any time to further disruptive and costly change, with unpredictable consequences yet to unfold.

Conversely, in theory anyway, there could be a society in which people's resources are wildly unequal but there is a consensus that the context of wild nature must be preserved. In the world we currently live in, many millions of people materially benefit from the system that they condemn. We live in the physical comfort, luxury even, that is provided by fossil fuels, mining, global trade, etc., while condemning those very things and desiring a world that we've never lived in. I agree that the rich and powerful are the most destructive and the most to blame for our current predicament, that seems to me to be beyond argument. But the belief that we could escape the coming disaster solely by equalizing the gap between rich and poor is naive.

Possibly small groups of human communities would survive, in pockets where climate effects and economic ""growth"" were not able to percolate. Typical civilization collapse though. I heard someone mention that acknowledging the problem is not going to help us solve it, and I agree, so might I suggest that we start forming communities immediately?

Dr Luke Kemp works for the ""Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge"", where he maybe a ""breath of sanity"" vs his AI x-risker dipshit colleages like Nick Bostrom, and whoever else there felatiates billionaries.  That's not exactly a complement to Dr Kemp. I suspect Kemp kinda launders real collapse work, ala by Joseph Tainter (https://www.resilience.org/stories/2022-07-18/joe-tainter-surplus-complexity-and-simplification/) and Peter Turchin (https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episode/164-peter-turchin) , into the AI x-risker world of Bostrom.  Yet Kemp remains a weak enoug Bostrom always wins debates, so like a human strawman, except quoting people who say important things.  We all gotta serve somebody (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL_UeBt_dmY) so hey whatever. Anyways, I'd ask Dr Kemp how he views population decline:  Anyone serious recognizes that current population decline benefits humanity.  In fact, western nations have made global problems much worse by maintaining their economies through immigration. > ""There are also about 10,000 nuclear weapons, technologies such as artificial intelligence and killer robots and engineered pandemics, all sources of catastrophic global risk."" Absolutely none of which represent existential threats, mostly hobby horses that entertain the billionaries who fund Kemp's employer.  It's only planetary boundaries (https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html) that really matter here ( previously (https://www.metafilter.com/198158/Will-Steffen) ). > ""Collapses in the past were at a regional level and often beneficial for most people"" Yes. Afaik everyone who studdies collapse agrees. There are many details like that and how the really useful technologies survived collapse, but that more abstract knowledge fades somewhat. > ""but collapse today would be global and disastrous for all."" We've no reason to beleive this claim per se. Yes, a speedy collapse would disrupt the trade upon which many people now depend, and upon which all luxeries depend, but afaik you'd expect ""civilization"" collapse being concurrent with population collapse caused by the global economy. I'd expect the opposite holds longer-term anyways: Collapse occuring sooner should reduce the severity long-term. A speedy collapse now could enable a transition into smaller non-trading nations, where certianly primary sector employment jumps, but some resources keep being spent maintaining limited STEM knowledge and practice anyways.  I suppose you'd want some collapse that resembles drone making in Ukraine (https://www.twz.com/news-features/critical-weapons-development-lessons-from-ukraine-are-not-being-learned-by-the-west) , except having a fuller supply chain, so basic solar and chip fabs, etc. Individual leaders having ""dark triad traits"" seems fairly normal, even good leaders live somewhere in that spectrum, like think Bill Gates, likely plenty Khoisan people too. In fact, I think leadership requires making choices elevate dark-ish aspects, even in otherwise normal individuals. I also think institutions constrain dark traits, while also enabling the greater successes of partially dark triad equiped people. Institutions solve progressively more social problems by expanding their roles and spawning new institutions, but this creates the essence of elite overproducion in Turchin's sense. We could argue which elites benefit soceity, and which do more harm than good ala bullshit jobs (https://www.metafilter.com/131103/Bullshit-Jobs) , but those jobs do address someones' problems, even if only bullshit problems.  We need collapse to make the real choices between serious and bullshit.  We need collapse to bring equality too, ala Walter Scheidel.

The Democrat strategy of chasing polls -- or to be more honest, misusing polls as an excuse not to do things like fight for M4A, then ignoring them to enact the wildly unpopular policies they actually support like genocide -- does not win elections. Instead it demonstrates to voters that they're right to disengage, politicians are all lying scum, and nothing will ever get better by voting. Do you think Republicans give a shit about the polls? Do you think dismantling the public school system has popular support? Yes it's the result of billions in dark money, but do you think that money went towards propaganda to convince the people? No, the point of it was to convince the politicians to just make it fucking happen. That's how capital exerts power.

So for instance, platformist Marxist groups sorta-kinda took over a union local and a couple of left orgs around here within my memory.  But: 1. Difficult to do in a large group 2. ""Entryism"" is what people you don't like do; ""organizing"" is what people you like do 3. In re Marxist platformists, if other people had been willing to show up more and do more of the boring stuff, the Marxist group wouldn't have been able to direct the larger org. Difficult to be really upset when the end result was that things more or less got done. With one exception, I can't think of any notably bad decisions that were made, and I am not clear whether, in that instance, another strategy would really have won anyway. I think that ""entryism"" has only been a problem when you have a really disciplined cadre going in to wrench the leadership of a small but powerful group away from the rest of the group in order to go in a really radical new direction.

Overall, the law drew 42% support and 52% opposition, performing slightly worse than Trump himself in the poll. It generated negative marks from 94% of Democrats, 12% of Republicans and 54% of independents. Nearly 70% of overall poll respondents said the law would help the wealthy, while just 7% said that group would be hurt. At least half of poll respondents said the legislation would harm poor people, the working class, Social Security beneficiaries, the U.S. economy, Medicaid recipients, nutrition-assistance recipients and the federal budget deficit. [...] Americans on health-insurance exchanges might pay higher prices because of Republicans’ decision—so far—not to extend expanded premium subsidies that expire after this year. And hospitals and states are already discussing ways to cope with the future cuts in ways that voters might notice. In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) said Democrats will continue holding rallies and giving speeches, noting it will be “incredibly important” for them to explain the legislation’s negative consequences. “We believe that if we reach enough people over the next 15 months, this Republican majority will be rejected,” Jeffries said.

Why it matters: The party is full of angst over how to retake the White House and win back the voters they lost to President Trump over the past decade. But they feel increasingly sanguine about taking back the House next year. Here's the five-part theory of the case for why Dems are optimistic about 2026, as laid out by more than a dozen of their top campaign staffers. The ""big, beautiful bill"" is polling terribly (https://www.axios.com/2025/07/01/trump-democrats-big-beautiful-bill-election-2026) . Cuts to Medicaid (https://www.axios.com/2025/07/08/medicaid-cuts-states) and the Affordable Care Act are expected to make the ""big, beautiful bill"" even more unpopular. Prices are still high despite Trump promising to bring them down. Economic approval had long been one of Trump's consistent political strengths and now is not (https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-trump-facing-headwinds-six-month-mark) . Trump's deportations are getting blowback after going well beyond violent criminals and gang members. Polls show Republicans losing their advantage (https://www.axios.com/2025/07/17/trumps-immigration-approval-ratings-sinks-new-low) on one of their key issues in the 2024 election. Democratic enthusiasm. A recent CNN poll (https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/politics/democrats-republicans-midterms-poll) found that 72% Democrats and Democratic-aligned voters are extremely motivated to vote in the midterm elections compared to just 50% of Republicans and Republican-aligned voters. Between the lines: Some Democrats are worried that victories in 2026 will stop the party from reckoning with its deeper issues and unpopularity. The party needs to change and victories will give party leaders excuses not to, they argue. Zoom in: In 2026, Democrats only need to win a handful of seats to take back the House majority. They also just successfully recruited former Gov. Roy Cooper (https://www.axios.com/2025/07/23/roy-cooper-run-north-carolina-senate-democrat) to run for Senate in North Carolina, as Axios first reported. Democrats believe they're getting the right kinds of candidates in the House: people with little connection to D.C. who can run against both parties. Midterms often favor the party out of power and Democrats have increasingly done better with college-educated voters who also tend to vote more often in non-presidential elections. Zoom out: The Democratic Party is facing headwinds of historic unpopularity that will make it harder to win back the House. The Wall Street Journal recently found (https://archive.ph/KNF1m) that only 33% of voters have a favorable view of Democrats and 63% have an unfavorable view — the highest percentage in the Journal's polling back to 1990. Other polls also look bad (https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/01/politics/cnn-poll-republicans-democrats) . Many of the cuts to Medicaid do not go into effect until 2027, so voters may not feel their effects by the midterms. Republicans in Ohio and Texas also might draw new congressional maps (https://www.axios.com/local/san-antonio/2025/07/28/texas-redistricting-abbott-republicans-risk) to help them win a few extra seats.

Mostly behind the scenes, but clearly visible in the Harris campaign with the red-carpet rollout for the likes of the McCains and the Cheneys. The other thing I've been hearing is that the state and local parties are having an incredibly hard time getting literally anyone under 40 to show up outside the big ticket elections. This is in my purple state, but I've seen people in other states say similar things. If you're a young progressive who feels like the Democratic party doesn't want you, you aren't incentivized to show up, which makes the establishment think there's no support for progressive policy, which makes young people feel like the Dems are out of touch and don't want them, round and round. (This is outside of the ridiculous ""pay your dues"" culture, which is its own problem.) Unless you're in a rich blue state, it's also very likely that your state party hates the national Dems waaaaaay more than you would ever expect. They have to take virtual meetings with DC 3rd-way centrists to beg them for funding and explain, politely, why possibly a consultant three years out of Yale Poli-Sci's fond childhood memories of vacationing in your state at his family's $4M summer house perhaps does not translate into an accurate understanding of the local electorate. No one feels more keenly the failures of the Democratic Party than red state Dems, who have been fighting against both Republicans and also the smug elitist wing of their own party for decades. I do tend to think this is a make-or-break moment for the Democratic Party as we know it. America has lost political parties before. Moving left seems the only possible way it can survive; not because progressive policies are so popular (although I believe they are), but because you cannot have a second political party when the other one is fascist.

I don't think this is just semantics.  there are historical reasons for the euphemism ""progressive"" in mainstream American political vocabulary.  I bet those reasons involve being afraid of not being able to counter asinine red scare type smears.  the seeming assumption that those reasons are ironclad laws of nature seems related to the issue, here. Bernie contributed to the semantic mess by confusing people on ""socialist"" (he may well be one in his personal convictions, who cares, but his proposals were primarily moderate social democratic stuff -- laudable in context but abusing the meaning of words).  but I like that politicians of his ilk seem to get that the enemy is going to deploy bullshit bircher vibes no matter what you do, so there's no point in euphemisms. may as well err on the side of leaning inaccurately hard into a label that people associate with political movements that, like, mean business, even if a bit scary for the boomers or whatever.  ""progressive"", as shorthand, is awful.  nobody wants to hear someone sound embarrassed about their own plans and positions.   that's how ""progressive"" sounds. in particular, y'all need people who handle your absolutely execrable media with the same contempt trump pretends to (trump actually loves the media, obviously), except with the exact opposite content and the exact opposite level of clarity to trump. and whenever y'all win some office, because of the thing where any asshole with enough money behind them can convince everyone to throw the bums out before they even get started, and wreck whatever progress was made, y'all are gonna have to take some cues re: legal/bureaucratic/constitutional constraints from people like trump, too, wherever relevant/possible.   otherwise the policy questions are pretty academic (and conversely, the electoral strategy questions are pointless if you've got no positive agenda).  I think this is the thing Fidel Castro warned Salvador Allende about, unfortunately accurately. I assume/hope Zohran Mamdani has thought through what to do about that last thing, though, because otherwise he's just a skilled politician with some popular good ideas upon whom everyone will sour when he gets in and every move he makes is bogged down in exactly the kind of legal and procedural and bureaucratic minefields that should be getting deployed against trump and his ilk (but over which someone who wants to do something good with power should have a plan for running roughshod if the realisation of the actual goals demands it). people who deserve a political party whose purpose is to actually obtain and wield power in service of their collective interests can tell that that doesn't exist, and one of the ways they can tell is that there's an admission of likely fecklessness baked right into the political vocabulary.

The term exists because at the height of the ""Progressive Era"" in the US (which Wikipedia will describe as 1890s-1920s, although I would say it lasted somewhat longer), there was a ""Progressive"" movement that was loosely aligned with, but very much separate from, the Socialist Party of Eugene Debs et al, which had absorbed the nascent Social Democratic Party of America just before the turn of the 20th century. And it's fair to say the Socialist Party of America had some... significant PR problems, including being opposed to US involvement in WWI, which split left-leaning voters in the US (often along regional or ethnic lines), and then later they had a classic left-wing schism over the whole Russian Communism thing, which caused the defection of the proto-tankies to the CPUSA... overall, it was probably just a bit too internationalist, too interested in arguing about political theory, than I suspect many Americans wanted in their politics. ""Progressive"", on the other hand, was a label that didn't have a political party firmly attached.  Most early 20th century Progressives were Republicans by party affiliation, but there were notable exceptions: e.g. William Jennings Bryan. You could be a ""Progressive"", or even just ""progressive"" on particular issues, without subscribing to a totalizing political theory with unsavory Russian connections. And given the success of the early 20th century American Progressives in terms of actual policy, I think sticking with the term is probably not a bad idea",6 favorites,['/favorited/2/8751235'],2025-07-31 07:06:00,Thursday

Give me the line in the US constitution that requires FPTP voting for congress. Second, ranked choice voting is requires  computer to calculate who won.  Auditing what a computer calculates is extremely hard. If you want a corruption-resistant near-proportional system: 1. Increase the number of Representative Seats 10 fold. 2. In each Congressional Riding, elect 10 Seats. 3. Allow someone to win more than Seat in Congress; their voting power in Congress is proportional to the number of Seats they hold. 4. The Seats in a Riding are distributed proportional to how the residents voted; for every 10% that vote for you, you get a Seat.  Remaining Seats are then distributed over the winners in proportion to their votes. --- The point of this is you can have a really simple election.  Each person picks 1 person they vote for on a piece of paper.  People at the riding can look at the paper and see ""they voted for person X"".  Counting is simple, and can be done by hand at each voting station, and the results (list of voters, total votes, total votes for each candidate) reported publicly.  Boxes can then be sent to a more central place to be computer counted. Corruption requires on-the-ground work proportional to the amount of corruption.

I understand the ad hominem critiques just fine. Ezra Klein represents a strain of Obama-era credulous neoliberalism that progressives believe has been discredited by reality, and they are not happy to see his ideas taken seriously. I don’t know much about Derek Thompson, but based on the right wing podcast interviews he gave to promote the book, he thinks there is value in building common cause with a politics I despise. The key contribution of Abundance isn’t a program of reforms or electoral strategy, it’s the description of a particular kind of sickness in the way that the government controls what gets built: regulations and processes were built to be a check on market forces, wealth, and racially-biased redevelopment projects to protect other values like trade unionism, the environment, city character, neighborhood communities. Over time, those processes were captured by the wealthy and by business. Today, the use of these processes to slow or stop development have become totally unlinked from the values they were intended to protect and is a crucial tool of the wealthy and big business for protecting its interests. Abundance posits that the way this intersects with politics creates a related dynamic. When progressive campaigns stir up public sentiment to solve a big problem, then saddle the implementation of the solution with so many additional requirements that it cannot address the main problem it was intended to solve, it burns the electorate out. If you are someone who cares about solutions for the problems we have now, the choice between Republican denial and Democratic incapacity is a distinction without a difference.

They only look the same if you start from the assumption that all regulations are good, work exactly as originally intended, and are never coopted by special interests. But the evidence plainly shows that, in particular, zoning regulations and *some* environmental regulations have in fact had problematic unanticipated effects, and have been abused by wealthy NIMBYs and others who profit from scarcity -- especially housing scarcity. If you reject this, then you're making common cause with all the white suburban single-family homeowners who want to keep their subdivisions sprawling and inhospitable to density. The ""abundance"" stuff I've mostly seen (and I admit I haven't read the book) is about loosening zoning restrictions so that people can, for example, convert their single-family home into a multifamily, build an accessory dwelling unit, etc., and so that it's much easier to build apartment buildings near transit stops and the like.  This kind of thing has literally been *illegal* in most of the U.S. since around the time of WW2. Our zoning and enviro regs are so dense and hard to navigate that they incentivize en-masse greenfield development -- i.e., developers buying farmland and building sprawl subdivisions on it -- because it's easier than building smaller, denser housing closer to urban centers.  That's f'ed up.  And we should change it. Some leftists seem to be just obsessed with public housing, to the exclusion of everything else, and have a burning hatred for all private landlords that leads them to scorn any type of housing that isn't built, owned, and leased by the government. But that type of arrangement hasn't historically worked out wonderfully in this country.  Just look up the horror stories experienced by folks who live in NYCHA housing here in NYC.  I think it has its place, and I'd love to see it reformed and expanded, but there's not a snowball's chance in hell that the U.S. is going to get out of our housing crisis purely by building more public housing units. That means that private property owners and *gasp* DEVELOPERS are going to have to be empowered to build more housing -- a lot more.  And yes, I regret to inform you, some of them may make some money in the process. As someone alluded to earlier, no less a leftist icon than Zohran Mamdani is backing some of this stuff.

Americans say they want a third party — but making it happen is tricky. (https://archive.ph/l6CGs) I think America is a pretty big, diverse country these days, you may have noticed. And to fit everybody into just two parties seems like kind of insanity, and it’s clearly not working. Also, it has divided this country into two teams — the red and the blue team — that have learned to absolutely hate each other. It’s created these artificial divisions around this zero-sum, winner-take-all electoral politics that is just really breaking down the foundations of democracy in this country. So, I think there was a time when it worked reasonably well for certain reasons, but that time is in the past. You will know that Elon Musk agrees with you. He says he wants to start a third party. He ran one of his polls [on X], and the question was: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” I’m looking at that poll now. Eighty percent of people said yes, 20 percent said no. How does that match up with reality in the US? Well, there are two parts to that question. One is: How many people want a third party? And then two is: How many people want that party to be somewhere in the middle? Now, the first part: How many people want a third party? That 80 percent is a little bit high. There might be some selection bias there, but it is close to polls that I’ve seen. Generally, about 60 to 70 percent of Americans say there ought to be more than two parties when polled. So, overwhelmingly, Americans say they want more than two parties. Now, is the party that they want a party in the center? That’s less clear. I think people’s perception of the political center depends on themselves. [Most] people think that they’re more reasonable and they’re more moderate. But in reality, when you look at the viewpoints of the American electorate, as I’ve done repeatedly, you see that the support for a genuine center party is limited to maybe 10 to 15 percent. But there is a lot of interest in parties that are maybe not as traditional. If so many voters want more options, why don’t we have more people in elected office from third parties? Here you’re hitting on the core problem, which is that we have a single-winner system of elections. So in a single-winner election, third parties become spoilers and wasted votes, because one of the two major parties is going to win every election. So, voting for a third party is just basically a protest vote, or maybe it could spoil the election. And as a result, most people don’t want to do that because they think, well, I want to vote for somebody who at least has a chance of winning. And, more importantly, people who have ambition in politics say, well, I’m not going to waste my time with one of these fringe parties. I want to actually win. So you get minor parties that are mostly cranks and weirdos and people say, well, I’d like to vote for another party, but not that third party",2 favorites,"['https://archive.ph/l6CGs', '/favorited/2/8747304']",2025-07-21 11:33:00,Monday

That last one was the impetus for creating zoning of any kind, begining a bit after the industrial revolution... but zoning as we know it in the USA is almost totally downstream of racism, period. Racial covenants were replaced with covenants against having the property be anything but an owner-occupied single-family dwelling, and then, after the Supreme Court gave them the go-ahead, towns in general established that sort of zoning ordinance to cover the majority of their area. Our degree of strict enforcement on population density just isn't found much outside of North America, and like a lot of not-good things unique to our part of the world, racism is mostly to blame. What's really interesting to me is how the underlying logic became an independent narrative totally decoupled from the racial motive. Every American knows that the correct way to live is in a single-family house with a big yard that requires a car to reach just about anything else. ""The town rallies to save XYZ from becoming a soulless apartment building"" is a cliché with no obvious racial undertone at all, and indeed is generally regarded as an ""obviously"" liberal narrative/perspective rather than a conservative one. Of course it can matter what XYZ is in practice — a homeless shelter? A youth center? But in real life rather than fiction, it's going to be a golf course or a gas station or simply a vacant lot. That would also be my quasi-answer to the really good point raised by RonButNotStupid: why isn't this argument, premised on ""bad"" examples of people fighting to preserve a golf course, not akin to tort reform arguments based on the hot coffee case?

And he regularly engages in good faith debates with people who disagree with him - he invited two critics (Zephyr Teachout and Saikat Chakrabarti) from the left on his podcast to talk through their critiques of the book (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-saikat-chakrabarti-zephyr-teachout.html) . Anyway, I think the divide between the Left and liberals on ""Abundance"" is a bit overblown - like others have pointed out, Zohran Mamdani has talked positively about some aspects of it (and Derek Thompson and Klein have both complemented Mamdani). And in the interview above, there is clearly a fair bit of agreement between Teachout/Chakrabarti/Klein. I do think it's worth noting that Klein has been pretty explicit that the book is not policy - it's a provocation.  At its core, have Democrats failed to see the potential downsides of some regulations? Are there times when the costs (in time and money) outweigh the benefits? There is a lot of room for disagreement on where you draw the line. I don't think it's accurate to say Abundance is anti-regulation, though I'm sure where some in this coalition will want to draw the line will likely spark disagreement with the Left (and myself, for whatever its worth). But unless you think there could never be too many government regulations, you aren't necessarily in disagreement with Abundance. I mean, I think most people here could agree that the fact that some affordable housing in CA costs $1,000,000 per unit (https://www.pacificresearch.org/why-californias-affordable-housing-costs-1-million-a-unit/) to build is a sign that something isn't working well and that this is clearly a problem. From a researcher on the issue: “ Soft costs” in California are a major culprit (https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/california-affordable-housing-costs-time/) . California property developers pay remarkably high fees for architectural and engineering services — triple the average cost in Texas. It’s five times as much or more if you’re building publicly funded, affordable apartments in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas...the biggest [soft cost] driving up California apartment costs? Time. A privately financed apartment building that takes just over two years to produce from start to finish in Texas would take over four years in California. It takes twice as long to gain project approvals and the construction timeline is 1.5 times longer. That means land costs must be carried for longer, equipment and labor are on jobsites longer, and that loans are taken out for a longer term, and so on. Most of the differences that the study uncovered stem from policy choices made by state and local governments. Many are legacies of the so-called “slow growth movement” in California, which has shaped housing production since the 1980s. You'll notice what is not being blamed: unions, environmental regulations, Leftists, or other identity groups. The author does note that needing to make buildings earthquake safe, union labor, and environmental regulations do contribute costs, but these are all relatively small compared to time delay costs. And as Klein pointed out in his interview with Teachout when she brought up unions, Europe has way more unionized labor than the US, and yet they manage to build housing and infrastructure faster and cheaper - clearly it's possible without treating workers badly (nor is that what Klein et. al. are advocating for)",11 favorites,"['https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-saikat-chakrabarti-zephyr-teachout.html', 'https://www.pacificresearch.org/why-californias-affordable-housing-costs-1-million-a-unit/', 'https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/california-affordable-housing-costs-time/', '/favorited/2/8747400']",2025-07-21 14:23:00,Monday

A lot of YIMBY rhetoric ignores this aspect and so has a real hard time garnering support from those communities that would be directly affected (and those of us that fight with and for those communities). I don't know that YIMBYs ignore the issue of displacement.  YIMBYs tend to point out that doing nothing also causes displacement -- possibly causing more displacement than building new housing would. Here's the problem in a nutshell: If a city or a neighborhood is experiencing a population influx -- possibly including an influx of people with higher incomes than the existing residents -- this, in itself, will cause displacement, due to competition for the existing housing stock.  Existing housing that used to be cheap will get more expensive. If you build more housing -- including market-rate housing -- many of the newcomers will move into it, instead of displacing people from existing housing. NIMBYs, including lefty NIMBYs, tend to see the new development as inherently evil -- as if the new development is itself what's causing increased rents in existing housing stock.  What they don't take into account is that (1) new market-rate housing tends to be built in places where there is already growing demand, and (2) if that demand is not met by new housing, it will be met by existing housing -- i.e., by newcomers competing with existing residents for what's there. People who reflexively oppose, say, new condo towers may do so out of a mixture of vague aesthetic revulsion and some kind of sociocultural animus toward newcomers in their neighborhood. This may be augmented by political theories about gentrification -- but sometimes the political theories may just be icing on the aesthetic/sociocultural cake. But blocking new development isn't going to make people stop wanting to move to popular neighborhoods.  It's just going to make newcomers bid up the scarcer existing housing stock, which is more likely to push existing residents out",9 favorites,['/favorited/2/8747403'],2025-07-21 14:28:00,Monday

What's funny about this conversation is that there is solid evidence (like literally the past) that if zoning were changed, the rich areas would be upzoned and increase in density first, generally leaving the poorer areas alone and behind.  Gentrification only occurs because with current zoning laws, the poorer people are more likely to rent and to move first of their own accord, thus they don't have the long history in a neighborhood to organize. In most cities that aren't growing there are far more neighborhoods in decline than gentrifying because the housing supply is adequate and poorer places continue to filter until they are fully abandoned. Also poor people move far more often then richer people, the average duration is like 5 years, whereas the average homeowner is pushing 7-10 years.

California has the 5th highest median wage, and the second highest (after Hawaii) Price-to-Income Ratio for housing. Massachusetts has the highest median wage, and the fourth highest ratio. I don't think it likely you are going to find any data that would support your thesis in the past 20-30 years. What you will find is that in 2024 we built more apartments in the United States than we did in 1974 for the first time since then, but the population in the US increased by 120 million people in that time. So there has been a 50-year deficit of multi-unit housing starts on a per capita basis. The people relocating from CA to neighboring states is probably driven more by home equity in CA being artificially inflated by Prop 13 for decades, which allows that minority of residents to arbitrage price gaps. The population of LA, Riverside and San Bernadino counties is almost more than NV, ID, MT, CO, WY & UT combined (5% of the all the people currently living in Idaho are receiving pension checks from CalPERS, the CA state pension fund).  It does not take a lot of migration from the former to the latter to severely distort housing markets. I'm sure rent arbitrage is happening, but at much smaller scale since the number of units just isn't there. So, yeah, the Abundance people can probably just be reduced to a single talking point, which is we should be doubling our housing production for the foreseeable future.

The question is whether those moneyed people take the houses of the less moneyed folks who are already there, or take newly built housing instead. New housing is generally neither (1) the thing that causes a neighborhood to become popular in the first place, nor (2) the cause of existing residents being displaced from existing housing. Some people see new housing being built at the same time that rents are going up, and incorrectly infer that the new housing is causing the rent increases. But new housing is usually a market response to rents that are already rising, due to an influx of newcomers that is already happening, and already driving up the prices of existing housing.

https://www.metafilter.com/209650/Psycho-History-Who-gets-to-decide-how-to-get-to-Denmark,kliuless,https://www.metafilter.com/user/3217,"> (https://www.metafilter.com/209650/Psycho-History-Who-gets-to-decide-how-to-get-to-Denmark#8747235) It would destroy the ""character of an older neighborhood,"" wrote some guy named Robert Reich. housing economist ed glaeser (https://www.metafilter.com/200377/The-Cost-of-Living-Housing-Crisis#8443640) in 2006 (https://web.archive.org/web/20230419183638/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/magazine/home-economics.html) (emphasis added): So, after sorting through a mountain of data, Glaeser decided that the housing crisis was man-made. The region's zoning regulations -- which were enacted by locales in the first half of the 20th century to separate residential land from commercial and industrial land and which generally promoted the orderly growth of suburbs -- had become so various and complex in the second half of the 20th century that they were limiting growth. Land-use rules of the 1920's were meant to assure homeowners that their neighbors wouldn't raise hogs in their backyards, throw up a shack on a sliver of land nearby or build a factory next door, but the zoning rules of the 1970's and 1980's were different in nature and effect. Regulations in Glaeser's new hometown of Weston, for instance, made extremely large lot sizes mandatory in some neighborhoods and placed high environmental hurdles (some reasonable, others not, in Glaeser's view) in front of developers. Other towns passed ordinances governing sidewalks, street widths, the shape of lots, septic lines and so on -- all with the result, in Glaeser's analysis, of curtailing the supply of housing. The same phenomenon, he says, has inflated prices in metro areas all along the East and West Coasts. [...] Meanwhile, it demonstrated to him how useful it can be to consider the relationship between actual construction costs and the market price of homes. That lesson seemed to apply not only to declining cities but also to places with extraordinary price appreciation, like the San Francisco or Boston metro areas. How could homes in these places be priced so much higher than construction costs? And why did the prices keep going up? Glaeser has come to believe that changes in zoning regulations may be the most important transformation in the American real-estate market since the mass acceptance of the automobile. In his view, these regulations have essentially created a ""zoning tax"" that has pushed prices far above construction costs. Very, very far above construction costs. It is not a perspective shared by all housing analysts; some economists have been far more inclined to blame high prices on high demand (spurred by low interest rates) or on rampant speculation. Others agree with Glaeser in emphasizing supply but not necessarily fixing on zoning. Karl Case, for instance, an economist at Wellesley College who counts himself a fan of Glaeser's, agrees that lack of supply has led to steep prices in the Boston area, but he attributes the housing shortage not just to zoning but also to the nature of the construction business and the scarcity of large desirable tracts of land. Still, among the half-dozen leading economists who study housing supply, there seems to be wide agreement that regulations have had a tremendous effect on prices. ""I think the evidence is overwhelming,"" says John Quigley, an urban economist at Berkeley who has looked specifically at the effects of regulation on the California market. As Glaeser says: ""It's so easy to forget the world that we were living in around 1970, when basically almost all of the value of houses was in the physical infrastructure. That was actually the cost. There was some land, and it was worth something, but it wasn't worth more than 20 percent of the value of the house."" Even in New York City, Glaeser says, the price of an apartment back then was essentially the cost of building the next floor. In researching New York City's housing prices, in fact, Glaeser and Gyourko discovered that over the past 30 years, the average height of new residential buildings in Manhattan decreased in size. ""That's crazy,"" he insists, especially in light of how much the demand to live in New York has increased. ""You know, if prices in Manhattan are skyrocketing, you should be building more and more at 50 stories, rather than at 30. Not the reverse."" So is it his contention that Manhattan could build far more than it has recently? ""Oh, for sure,"" he says. ""Technologically? Certainly. No reason why you couldn't."" Let's go back to Manhattan in the 1920's, Glaeser says. ""New York in the 1920's is a pretty developed place, a pretty mature place. But they're producing a hundred thousand units a year. They're tearing up swaths of Manhattan and building higher buildings."" That would be legally and politically impossible today, but as he and Gyourko see things, it is precisely those legal and political roadblocks to ""tearing up"" the city that have made the place so expensive. Actually, in 2004, the two men took a close look at Manhattan and estimated that one half or more of the value of condominiums in the borough could be thought of as arising from some type of regulatory constraint preventing the construction of new housing. The data for co-ops (because of their ownership structure) was more difficult to interpret, but Glaeser and Gyourko suspect that their estimates probably apply to the Manhattan market as a whole. Glaeser has little doubt that there are regular cycles in real-estate markets; the recent slowdown may perhaps be evidence of one of those cycles. But he says he doesn't think that the supply issues are something that will disappear, even if the demand for housing levels off or drops over the next few years. ""We will never go back to a world in which developers in Massachusetts or California or New York are able to do what they want with their property unimpeded by their neighbors,"" he says. And what surprises him is that the changes in how we have treated property rights for the last 40 years -- who gets permission to build, the size and location of what owners are permitted to build -- have been the subject of virtually no national dialogue, even as the effects on prices, in his view, have been extraordinary. This is not to suggest that Glaeser wants New York or Boston to become another Houston or Phoenix, where developers build without hindrance and housing, as a result, stays cheap. ""I'm pretty sure that Boston and California have gone too far to one extreme,"" he says. ""But I'm not sure that Texas hasn't gone too far to the other extreme."" He says he tends to think that officials in the Boston and New York metro areas need to allow for more housing when the market gets tighter again. At the very least, he says, officials should discuss the long-term effects of restricting home building. And there is a bigger point here anyway, he says. Zoning and housing supply ultimately determine not only who lives in a city but also the very nature of these places. Boston, San Francisco and Manhattan are obviously becoming rarefied destinations, mostly for America's elites (Glaeser calls the cities ""luxury goods""), with housing floating beyond the reach of the young and the middle class. These cities' economies are in the process of becoming boutique, too, accommodating only the most skilled and privileged. Their desire to limit construction and grow not in buildings and population but in prices has, in effect, begun to shape their destiny. ""A healthy city is one that has a healthy mix of demographic groups,"" Glaeser says. ""Shutting out your 25-to-40 year-olds? That feels like a bad strategy for urban innovation."" But economists, like any social scientists, often discover that the leap from conducting research to making policy can be enormously difficult. It can take years, perhaps decades -- and that's when it happens at all. Glaeser is fortunate in that he already has the ear of mayors and state legislators who at least took notice of his recent work on regulations in the Boston metro area. Still, he admits it will be difficult to go against the current momentum. ""I'm not in any sense trying to suggest that we want a developer's paradise where you can build anything, anywhere,"" he says. ""But I sure as heck think the current situation happened by happenstance, happened by changing the legal norms, which in no sense is guaranteed to yield a socially desirable outcome."" Homeowners, he points out, have a strong incentive to stop new development, both because it can be an inconvenience and also because, like any monopolist, stopping supply drives up the price of their own homes. ""Lack of affordable housing isn't a problem to homeowners,"" Glaeser says; that's exactly what they want. ""The thing you want most is to make sure that your home is not affordable if you own it. And for that reason, there's absolutely no reason to think that little suburban communities with no businesses that are run essentially by their homeowners will make the right decisions for the state as a whole, for the business in the area, for the country as a whole."" As a matter of fact, Glaeser long ago became convinced that there is a lot riding on supply. ""The welfare of the world is shaped in part by our urban form, by the way that we live, the way our communities are constructed,"" he says. ""These things like growth controls have changed the way communities are developed."" Joseph Gyourko shares the view that where we live, and why we sort ourselves into those places, have profound effects on society, culture, politics and business. ""It's important,"" he says of the sorting process. ""It's not an innocent thing."" notably, housing is affordable in toyko because people don't consider their homes (and neighborhoods) as an asset (to hoard), but a place to live (https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/actually-japan-has-changed-a-lot) : * (https://www.metafilter.com/198132/Builders-Remedy-San-Fransokyo-Part-Deux-Electric-Boogaloo) Japan’s fervor for constant scrap-and-build construction is a major reason why rent there is so affordable, and why local politics haven’t halted dense development as they have in the West. Wingfield-Hayes opens his article (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63830490) by complaining that Japanese houses tend to depreciate instead of appreciate: In Japan, houses are like cars. As soon as you move in, your new home is worth less than what you paid for it and after you've finished paying off your mortgage in 40 years, it is worth almost nothing. It bewildered me when I first moved here as a correspondent for the BBC - 10 years on, as I prepared to leave, it was still the same. Weirdly, this is presented as a chronic problem — something Japan should have fixed long ago, but hasn’t. But in reality, depreciating real estate is one of Japan’s biggest strengths .

And what keeps this supposedly limited and hyperfocused only on the supposedly bad regulations from becoming a slippery slope that ends in us working 16 hour days for company scrip starting at age 6. I've already made my case. We stopped building new housing at the rate of population growth decades ago. Both private and public. And now it's not mathematically possible to buy (or rent in most cases) housing at the median wage in most cities. That's not under the Abundance regime. I'm not sure exactly what you would call it (since it's so strikingly bi-partisan), but anyone who argues against aggressively building more housing, regardless of the source, is arguing for the status quo. I donno man, write a law saying the state or the feds have to build one unit of publicly owned housing for every private residence, I'll email my reps. Most YIMBYs don't care about the sources of the housing. The math is, there aren't enough LIHTC programs to create enough units. And we know, incontrovertibly, that people who reliably vote Dem also organize ferociously to oppose any housing at all. To act like there is some correlation because child worker protections and eliminating single family zoning in cities is just weird and gross. Faircloth happened under Bill Clinton (who was busy writing the Welfare Reform Bill, together two actions that may have done as much damage collectively to black communities as the Urban Renewal / highway construction in the 50s and 60s), not Woodrow Wilson.

Also not 100% sure I'd characterize myself as an ""Abundance person"", just that they're (possibly disingenuously? or maybe just some of them?) trying to solve a large problem while remaining within the world of things that can be accomplished without also implying a pony. But to your question, I wouldn't have any problem at all, at least conceptually, with the government taking advantage of economies of scale to build (e.g.) blocks of quality but not luxurious flats all over cities, as a means of expanding overall housing stock, increasing density and thereby lowering overall housing costs. The real question is, how do you get those flats into people's hands? And that's likely where we'd disagree. I'd say, give people with low savings but steady incomes slightly below-rate mortgages with no or very little down payment and then run the buildings as condos. Or turn them over to management companies with strict regulations about whether and how much the rent can go up, and let them out to whoever wants them (just not private equity or other investors) and let the market take over. I would not support government-built, -owned, and -managed public housing, outside of boutique usages like military bases, because it always turns into a pocket of concentrated poverty and dysfunction. 2) As I understand it, the point is not to DEregulate, but rather to streamline regulation, so I don't really think your question has much to do with the situation. The complaint about the regulations is that the whole process takes way too long for developers. Undoubtedly, some of the people calling for streamlining are being disingenuous about it, but I don't see any problem with (e.g.) all of the permitting being pulled into one office where everything is done in parallel. Also: I still don't understand how streamlining regulation and building more housing has anything at all to do with ""throwing trans people under the bus"".

He's painting regulations of any sort at all as impediments to growth and prosperity. To me that's dangerous language, it sounds all but identical to the way Project 2025 talks about regulation. As far as trans people and the bus goes, it's in the article. Not directly in that language but that's what all the stuff about not being distracted by culture war stuff means. When people like Klein et al talk about not being distracted they mean abandoning civil rights because the sacred cis het white conservative Chrisian men who matter most in their minds don't like other people getting civil rights.

They talk in grand terms about liberating American business from burdensome regulation (agian, Project 2025/Ronald Reagan speak) and we all know what that means because we can watch Trump's goons doing it in real time as they dismantle a century of worker protections in the name of liberating American business from burdensome red tape. Twits in LA blocking apartments and metro stations are NIMBY bullshit. Environmental review is not. But Klein lumps it all together and explicitly calls for Houstioning the entire country. Which worked out really poorly for Houston and cost a fuckton in insurance payouts and FEMA payouts for the people who had houses built by the glorious unfetteredd free market in flood zones. And Klein goes further, he doesn't just talk about housing. He's talking about industry, energy, everything. He's talking, in other words, about ending the regulations that are written in the blood of dead and maimed workers. OSHA doesn't just make up regs for fun, those regulations are all the result of someone dying, or at besst being mangled I see no reason whatsoever to think that all this Ezra Klein stuff will do anytihng but further enrich the zillionaires while hurting us.

I don't think this is a thing the average American would identify as our country's main problem. I totally disagree with this. The average American is a struggling person in a high population state. There are fewer wealthy people than poor people, even in high cost of living, high wage regions, and by definition there are more people overall. We're not just talking about New York and San Francisco here. We're talking about most cities. Almost any place in the country that is an engine for upward mobility in its region is experiencing this phenomenon. Housing costs & childcare are the biggest expenses in the average household, and when those items are expensive, the liberty and ability to thrive and have the leisure to make a rich life are constrained. I grew up in, and no longer live, in a small city at the north edge of the greater Los Angeles region. It wasn't a particularly expensive place until the 90's. In my lifetime I have seen my working class, Latino family transformed by these pressures. Those who can stay in the area are living with 2 or 3 families under one roof, anchored by a grandmother who bought her own house when housing was more abundant. Those who value living independently are moving 2-3 hours away into less expensive areas in the Central Valley or Inland Empire (becoming gentrifiers there, for that matter). They are priced out of the experience of having close extended family relationships where every adult can establish their own household. That takes a toll, and nobody wants to hear about rent control. They want to be able to afford to live independently, and they do not care ideologically how it happens. Rent control may be helpful in certain circumstances. Higher wages would be a good thing. Neither of those are going to meaningfully change this issue until a lot more housing, public and private, is built.

The book is a (highly successful) effort to create conversation and momentum around this as a problem that the Democratic Party could do more to address in an effort to both make the country a better place and regain political power. I think Henry Farrell (https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/we-need-usable-futures) makes this point better than I could: Because I am weird, I think that the most immediately useful aspect of Klein and Thompson’s book is not its specific argument about how to get to the future.** It is that the book has the promise to reorient the presentists around the prospect of an attractive future, and the different paths you might take to get there. On the one hand, as Dan Davies says (riffing on post-punk philosophizing), if you don’t have a dream then how’re ya gonna have a dream come true? On the other, no single dream is capable of foretelling the One True Path To Abundance (or, for that matter, any other desirable goal) so you want to have useful arguments between people with different dreams, and different plausible paths. Out of abundance, Abundance came. Something that likely isn’t obvious if you haven’t written a book for a broader audience, is how much writing is about winnowing down. You are writing about a vast, complex topic for an audience that is almost certainly impatient with complexities. You summarize difficult and heated debates among people deeply concerned with the topic you are writing on, but you can’t present more than than the thinnest abstraction of what they said, and perhaps not even that. Your duty is not to the participants in those debates (much though they may be annoyed if they aren’t mentioned), but to a general public whose interest, very reasonably, is not in the particulars of who argued what, when, and who said what in response, but in what is immediately relevant to the outside world. This movement is gaining momentum because a large spectrum of people are feeling this pain, and want to do something about it. There are plenty of leftists who are also generally pro-abundance. Wherever you sit politically, denying that housing is not a major problem in much of the US today, in blue states especially, and the negative effects of that, seems extremely out of touch.

No, I'm not in favor of ""cutting red tape"" or ""eliminating regulation"" as a general strategy or default position. MAYBE the biggest obsticle to housing is some Hermes Conrad style dystopian nightmare of all that can go wrong with bureaucracy. But I damn sure don't trust Ezra Klein and his brand of right wingers in disguise when they say that's the problem. I do note that all the builders seem to be interested in is more McMansions out in the suburbs and exurbs. Here in San Antonio that's close to 100% of all new housing under construction. Seems more like a problem of profit models than a problem of bureaucracy to me. Which makes me suspicous about people who tell me the problem is really the horrible red tape and not the problem I see more or less everywhere else which is zillonaires milking the system for the last cent and squeezing us all they can. I'm pretty doubtful that the money companies that own most of the rental properties in the USA are exactly eager to build cheap housing and reduce their profit margins. They like the situation as it is. But they'd LOVE to have fewer regulations getting in the way of their massive cheating. And I'm doubly suspicious about people who claim they can make us richer without clawing back all the wealth stolen by the zillionaires and some regulations with real teeth to keep them from screwing us out of all our money again. We've seen this bullshit before. Scammer: We just need to get rid of all this burdensome regulation and then you'll have so much more money! Voters: YAY! Then a giant corporation rumbles by to suck up all the money and leave the voters worse off than before.

But since 2011, the city has been building for the future. As one of the fastest-growing metropolises in Europe, Vienna needs new housing. On the site of the former Aspern airfield, a new city within the city is taking shape — built around an artificial lake: Seestadt. ""Building Visions"" profiles this massive project and Swedish architect Johannes Tovatt, who developed the master plan. For him, it's a lifelong mission. “Let spaces be ambiguous!” is his motto. His plan is flexible and adapts to the needs of incoming residents. Intentionally open areas inspire people to shape their environment and start community gardens. Designing and co-creating are also central to the many co-housing projects and building collectives in Seestadt. Residents join forces to actively participate in planning their homes. Their goal: vibrant, connected neighborhoods. Social housing is also an integral part of the development — after all, Vienna owes much of its high quality of life to its tradition of public housing. It all started with a subway stop — because here, people come first, then the cars. Seestadt is connected to Vienna’s metro network, and schools, shops, and recreational facilities are all within easy walking or biking distance. Even the traffic concept follows a master plan — aiming to make Seestadt just as livable and lovable as old Vienna. @ holz-bau.bsky.social‬ (https://bsky.app/profile/holz-bau.bsky.social/post/3luifj6b4ns27) : ""social housing is not just great housing policy - it's a great political policy as well. run on it. fund it. win. bigly.""

https://www.metafilter.com/209650/Psycho-History-Who-gets-to-decide-how-to-get-to-Denmark,kliuless,https://www.metafilter.com/user/3217,"> (https://www.metafilter.com/209650/Psycho-History-Who-gets-to-decide-how-to-get-to-Denmark#8747944) I think Henry Farrell makes this point better than I could The Abundance Debate We're Not Having (https://www.combinationsmag.com/the-abundance-debate-were-not-having/) - ""To shift American politics onto more productive grounds, the abundance agenda needs a broader cross-ideological debate than critics or advocates alike have allowed."" The central problem of American politics, Klein and Thompson imply, is not conflict but the scarcity that fuels it. If we lived in a world of real material abundance—for example, where people had sufficient access to housing and the other resources necessary for a good life rather than just consumer goods—people would be less dissatisfied. Such abundance might provide an indirect response to Klein’s previous book on political polarization. The best way to solve America’s political polarization, the book slyly hints, might be to side-step it: to shift American politics onto new grounds of debate about new topics where political disagreement might even turn out to be productive. If we are all fighting over the best way to increase the supply of things that everyone wants to have, we’re more likely to discover solutions that make everyone better off. Unsurprisingly, that is not the spirit in which many have interpreted the book. Some centrists—who believe that the left made Democrats lose the 2024 election—have deployed the abundance agenda as a cudgel to batter their ideological enemies. Some leftists see abundance as a stalking horse for a neoliberalism that systematically ignores the problematic concentration of power and influence in favor of arid technocracy. It is easy to project because Abundance has little explicit to say about democratic contestation and the gaining and losing of power. The book invokes the importance of the public interest (as opposed to the manifold interests of groups) without properly explaining how to figure out what that is. Self-interested groups can—as Klein and Thompson argue—gum up policy through imposing layer after layer of requirements. Equally, however, it’s impossible to figure out even the roughest notion of what the public good might be without organized contention among interests. Because of this omission, two somewhat different kinds of argument get jumbled together: the general claims for abundance, which a lot of people might agree is a good thing, and proposals about the specific ways we might get there, which are more likely to provoke dissent. The first involves the point that liberals (and, by implication, leftists, moderates, and conservatives too) ought to focus on abundance as their goal. The second is Klein and Thompson’s more particular diagnosis of what has gone wrong with American politics and how to set it right. The two are distinct. You can believe in the first without the second, and even accept much of the second without the first. You might, for example, dislike the politics of zoning laws without anticipating that getting rid of them would help open the floodgates of prosperity. I imagine that Klein and Thompson, like the rest of us, believe that they are absolutely right on their particular analysis of what has gone bad and how to fix it. Equally, I think that they’d count it as a victory if people start arguing with that diagnosis and proposing their own alternative paths toward abundance. Long-term political success is often less about winning a particular fight than shaping the ground and stakes of future contestation. That is why a second question lurks behind Klein and Thompson’s query about solving problems over supply. What would political disagreements look like if they were fights over how best to achieve abundance? As it happens, Klein and Thompson’s project is in part the product of such arguments. Just a few years ago, many conservatives and libertarians seemed to want to talk seriously about the relationship of governments to markets in producing abundance. Far to one side of this debate, socialists were engaging in their own internal discussions over whether a state-planned economy could produce abundance without capitalism. [...] In actuality, the book’s extended argument is that we need government to help build a better future, but government must be transformed if it is to do its job properly. so, who gets to decide? @ glenweyl.bsky.social‬ (https://bsky.app/profile/glenweyl.bsky.social/post/3lqsmggyc7c24) : ""As much as I admire @ ezrakleinbot.bsky.social (https://bsky.app/profile/ezrakleinbot.bsky.social) , I don't think there is any realistic chance that trusting his posse to know how to get sh*t done will go any better than trusting the person who is manifestly one of the world's most effective business people to.

 (https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/two-days-talking-to-people-looking-for-jobs-at-ice/) One of the ICE applicants I spoke with seemed to have an insatiable desire for conflict [...] All his life, he said, he had hoped to fight wars in Iraq or Afghanistan. He’d joined the army hoping to fulfill this desire. But our foreign wars had wound down by the time of his enlistment, and he never got a chance to fight abroad. “I learned all these skills in the army—smash and grabs, site exploitation—and never got to use them,” he said. “So I’m here to kind of do what I learned to do over there, but this time here, defending my country.” [...] There was the young, taciturn southerner managing a batting cage near New Orleans, and the pimply youth from Kentucky, churning out Yahoo Finance content for twenty dollars an hour. Both said they were tired and bored. The latter said his father had been in ICE, but he “didn’t really know what he did.” I spoke to a gregarious New York police officer who was fed up with patrolling Times Square and all “the savages” there. Another applicant said he was sick of installing office furniture in properties subleased by the United States Marines. A blind man I spoke to, who was hoping to find a data-centric position with ICE, said he was sick of his current job collecting child support payments from delinquent parents. At present, he said, his “hands were tied” because the law in his state forbade him from sending in sheriffs to collect money from deadbeat dads. In a lilting, basso voice, he told me that “in college, I wrote several papers about the harms of illegals in America.” The last applicant I spoke to said he didn’t care much about the politics of ICE—it was just that he thought his taxes shouldn’t be used to buy school supplies for “illegal alien children.” What he was really interested in, he said, was parlaying his wages as a deportation officer into buying Airbnbs. “My classmates came up in the same environment as me,” he said, “but now they’re off posting photographs of Lamborghinis on Instagram, standing on balconies of waterfront apartments.” His dad had also been in ICE [...] Once, in the early part of his career, the man had gotten to travel to Southeast Asia on various deportation flights and had sent his son photographs of a beautiful waterfall in Cambodia. “I was like, what the fuck dad?” the young man said. “I thought you were supposed to be deporting people!” The prospect of travel excited this applicant. And in fact over and over the DHS agents at the fair emphasized how it was the best part of their job. A longtime ICE agent said he had accompanied undocumented immigrants on deportation flights to more than fifty countries and stayed in numerous three- and four-star hotels. A White House rooftop sniper said that she had had “amazing experiences in foreign countries” and that the camaraderie of her sniper team reminded her of her college volleyball team. A CBP agent in Arizona said his favorite part of the job was riding horses through the mountains. The staff of the EMT Hazardous Agent Mitigation & Medical Emergency Response team (Hammer) said that he traveled with his ambulance all over the world, loading it into massive C17 airplanes and then sleeping beside it midair. He said it was “almost like camping.” The motivating force behind American career fascism would appear to be wanderlust. My conversations with prospective Enforcement and Removal Operation officers tended to follow the familiar script of engagement with the most banal people on Tinder, the kinds of people who post airplane emojis in their bios. Granting that the banality of evil, as an explanation, has itself become banal, it was hard to know what else to make of all this. The US is filled with “pretty nice guys” who are ready to inflict, who have already inflicted, senseless and life-shattering violence on innocent, impoverished people. [...] This is a disgusting country, I thought, irredeemable visually, psychically, morally, and ethically, and whatever is likable about our people’s warm patter does not in any way forgive what we have done to the world. Furthermore, it isn’t hard to bring politeness and evil into view at the same time",40 favorites,"['https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/two-days-talking-to-people-looking-for-jobs-at-ice/', '/favorited/2/8744086']",2025-07-11 10:45:00,Friday

Agreed, but with the caveat that this will proceed with profound levels of incompetence.

Hiring a bunch of losers with violent tendencies and letting them trample all over other jurisdictions is all but guaranteed to have complicated downstream effects.

The lack of due process, the chaotic raids, the masked gunmen, the lack of uniforms or identification: these are all designed to spread terror yes, but also they are hoping for dead ICE agents.

https://www.metafilter.com/209533/Surgical-center-staff-demand-to-see-ICE-warrant,gimonca,https://www.metafilter.com/user/11564,"Okay, I've been doing some back-of-envelope numbers. ICE is not that large, at the moment. Their self-reported staffing numbers are 21,000 right now, including desk staff. Before this year's budget bill, they paid for this with an annual budget of $9 to $10 billion dollars. This year's budget bill adds in $30 billion for more ICE staffing. There's more ICE money in there, too, for the ""border wall"" and physical camps, and some of that might be shiftable to pay for even more staffing, but for now, let's stick to the $30 billion figure. ICE themselves have stated they want to hire 10,000 more agents. But with 30 billion to work with, they could hire as many as maybe 200,000 or more (assuming such people were available, hireable, trainable, etc.). Yes, these sound like big numbers. However, the United States is a big country. For context, I went back and looked at police state scenarios in the 20th Century. Germany just before World War II. The Soviet Union in Stalin's last years. China under Mao, Indonesia under Suharto, Spain under Franco, Argentina and Chile under their respective juntas. When you assess the staffing size of the internal policing infrastructures of these authoritarian states, it's difficult to do apples-to-apples comparisons, and there's a lot of guesswork. But at a high level, you come to the conclusion that most of them had about one internal security person for each 200 to 300 people in the general population. How does that compare with ICE today, or with possible ICE expansion? The U.S. has a population of 340 million. At 20k, current ICE is at a staffing level of one person per 17000 population. If you add in a huge staffing increase within ICE itself, let's say up to 340,000 employees in ICE, you're still only up to one person per 1000 population. You've got a ways to go before you hit Hitler, Stalin or Pinochet levels--it would have to be four times what was in the latest budget bill. Other existing federal agencies (FBI, ATF, etc.) are similarly low-staffed compared to current levels at ICE. They're specialized to their immediate goals, they're not built to oversee the population at large. Now, there are ways to get to police state levels of staffing. The administration could try to shift all the other ICE money to staffing (the border wall money, etc.), that would get them part of the way there. (Go through another budgeting cycle, and the executive branch could simply ask for more money, too--given the trillions that the overall budget is adding to the debt, several tens of billions would be ""doable"". I'd like to say that Republicans would be torn between ""balancing the budget"" versus paying for a police state, we've learned again that worrying about debt is pure posturing from Republicans. They don't care.) Or--the administration could ramp up the pressure on local police forces, who number well over a million across the country. Nationalizing local police forces would put the federal administration where it would have a staffing size that could be used to implement an authoritarian state. Likewise, components of the National Guard are a source of staffing that could move the officer-to-population ratios into the police-state range. From my view, this month's budget bill doesn't really change that underlying factor. The current administration is likely to continue pressure on local police forces and the local governments that employ them, and to continue to use or abuse National Guard forces. That's where the uniformed staff are, that's where the numbers are. (A person could haggle over the fine-grained specifics of some of the numbers and estimates here. I still think the high-level conclusion stands, even if some of the individual numbers could be adjusted.)",8 favorites,['/favorited/2/8744374'],2025-07-12 12:20:00,Saturday

The ruler exercises his power without restraint, at his own discretion and above all unencumbered by rules or by any commitment to an ideology or value system. The binding norms and relations of bureaucratic administration are constantly subverted by arbitrary personal decisions of the ruler, which he does not feel constrained to justify in ideological terms. As a result corruption reigns supreme at all levels of society. The staff of such a ruler is constituted not by an establishment with distinctive career lines, like a bureaucratic army or a civil service, recruited based on more or less universal criteria, but largely by people chosen directly by the ruler. Among them we very often find members of his family, friends, business associates, or individuals directly involved in using violence to sustain the regime.

The world's most advanced aircraft may be, technically, an excellent model. It can still hit the side of a mountain if some over-confident dude on ketamine gets in the cockpit, disables all the computer systems, drunkenly plots his own course through a mountainside, and then falls asleep at the controls. The potential strength of LLMs is largely being able to train them on huge datasets and use them as human-friendly frontends to interact with the data by posing new questions to the LLM that would take human data analysts a lot of time to sift through and answer. Sometimes that works and reveals previously unseen patterns in the data. Sometimes it doesn't. If you skip the data and train it on edgy social media posts, then you just get a chatbot capable of accurately imitating the shitty posts you see on your far-right vanity social media site. Elon & Co. constantly tweaking the program to get it say stuff they like to hear isn't really ""training"" it to do anything other than say stuff they like to hear. It's still reflecting patterns in the data, but those patterns are just that comments with Hitler jokes and rape jokes and stories about riding big black cocks get a lot of engagement. We already knew that though. I'm sure Elon is still convinced his LLM project is going to return some genius lifehack solution to the world where we can change this one little thing and everything will be fixed. I'm guessing he went into this hoping he could feed the world's problems into an advanced enough computer simulation, get the answer, and then run out and shout it from the rooftops so he can playact the hero that saved humanity. He may still think that. I don't know. He's probably too far gone at this point. Maybe he'll just keep grooming his AI to advocate genocide as the solution until he has heard it so many times that it sounds like the only solution left. But Nazi-flavored chatbots is where we are now. When we plug LLMs into serious datasets they start giving us responses that point to patterns we find politically or ideologically inconvenient to deal with. They'll return solutions that require large-scale change and collective effort. Better to label those conclusions as biased and reprogram the machines to tell us edgy jokes so we can all keep having a good time. This isn't exploring the potential of AI to advance human knowledge. This isn't some noble endeavor to pick truth out of all the noise.

The hell it did…[clicks] Oh, okay. Chatbot Arena. Sure. For actual leaderboards focused on doing somewhat useful things like programming (AIder or LiveBench): hell no. DeepSeek R1 + Claude-3.5 ate Grok’s lunch a month before it sat down at the table, then Gemini-2.5 Pro clocked everybody. But full agreement that Grok is up there with the worst of the worst when it comes to the American bulldozer approach to LLMs (aka spending and polluting your way to victory). and they can do so in very subtle ways, not just in ways as obvious as Declaring Oneself MechaHitler People had noticed the slow rampup in ChatGPT praising them long before it reached the “You Are The Lightbringer” psychosis and media flap a couple months back that caused them to begin tamping it back down. It’s likely an engagement optimization algorithm was let loose with no sane ceiling set. The reason I mention this is that we don’t know when precisely that was initiated, and reports were a very slow trickle for weeks before they turned into a flood. So, yes: it can be done subtle and indeed has been done subtle but if you let it self-manage without hard limits it will give itself away when it spirals out of control. Elon being Elon, “spiraled out of control” is the default setting. hate to say it, but humans trained on the same corpus end up as Nazis, so I guess AI is more human than we thought.

https://www.metafilter.com/209484/The-America-Party,If only I had a penguin...,https://www.metafilter.com/user/84306,"FPTP stabilizes n=2 parties. ? Is this true? Are there other FPTP countries besides the U.S. where there are two parties that are essentially the only two parties? Canada is FPTP and has had anywhere between 3 and 6 parties with decent chances of doing some winning in every election in my lifetime. Anyway, I think it would be fantastic if he did this and it should be encouraged, for several reasons: 1. I really don't understand how the two-party system in the U.S. and the primary system aren't a textbook case of corruption. There are literally people elected using the money and the powers of government to favour some political parties over other political parties. That's the very definition of corruption. Now they're going to use it to keep this new party down (like they keep all other parties down), but I have some small amount of dim-witted hope that if the party can take hold it might -- for it's own benefit -- do something to tamp down this corruption. 2.  Obviously I'm sure I have no love of this party or its likely policies, but I am happy to have the American imagination opened to the idea that there is no god-given reason why there should be exactly two parties and there are benefits to having more. There is no law of the universe that FPTP results in two parties. There are lots of places with more parties. Parties can come and go and that's ok. They are not carved in stone. You do not owe some kind of lifetime loyalty or membership to this party because this party is a now thing, not the very essence of your being, or of American politics, or of anything else. It is not your identity. It is just who you voted for for a particular position in the last election. 3. And of course, getting these benefits from a party-on-the-right is the best way to do it because it will split the vote on the right. Hurrah. Sign me up for the America Party. I mean not actually me because I'm not American, but i think if any of you have the chance you should absolutely sign whatever is necessary to get the party or its candidates registered. You don't have to vote for him or want to vote for him to want the party to exist. That said, I find it bizarre the idea that he would launch everywhere-all-at-once if your hope is to actually win.

In our 2-party system, each party is really a coalition of multiple blocs -- e.g., the Dems are a coalition of environmentalists, labor groups, social progressives, etc., and the GOP is a coalition of business interests, social conservatives, xenophobes, etc. In a multi-party system, those groups tend to be broken out into separate parties, but they form coalitions after elections in order to create a government.  The results are not necessarily dramatically different from what the U.S. system delivers, notwithstanding some Americans' belief that they are. But more recently I've come to feel that multi-party systems do offer one advantage over our duopoly: more transparency.  A lot of Americans really don't understand how our big, messy coalition parties work.  Since I'm on the left, I see this most clearly in many folks' endless frustration with the Democratic party. People assume that the fact that the party doesn't seem to mirror their own interests is due to incompetence or corruption.  But they generally don't take the time to try to understand the complicated coalition that makes up the Dem electorate... and if they did, they might see that most Democratic politicians are representing constituencies that contain a broad swath of voting blocs, not all of whom are equally progressive (e.g., older black voters who want a more progressive economic system, but aren't out-and-out socialists, and who may be socially moderate to conservative, and have concerns about crime and immigration). If we had, say, 4 to 6 different parties, people could vote for candidates more closely attuned to their own preferences.  Then they'd get to see the deal-making and coalition-building happen out in the open (more or less) after elections.  While, again, I don't know that this would deliver measurably better policy outcomes, it might make people *feel* better represented.

As for economic inequality, I think it's risen in a lot of countries in recent decades.  I'm not sure how much the U.S. version is specifically a product of our party system.  There were waves of neoliberal deregulation in many developed countries in the '70s, '80s, and '90s. And as for the cost of health care: We have a uniquely weird and dysfunctional health care system, with a highly specific history.  Employers started offering health insurance in the 1940s because, during WW2, they were facing government-imposed wage controls.  They couldn't pay more than their competitors to lure the best employees, but they *could* offer health insurance as a perk, to distinguish themselves from other employers. That system ended up more or less accidentally becoming the cornerstone of most of our postwar health care delivery system.

You learn from you are very young to vote tactically, and the various coalitions are IMO much better representations of voter sentiment than whatever comes out of a two-party system. Numerous surveys have shown that most US voters would prefer social democratic outcomes, if they just weren't called that.  (You need to know that the Democrats in the US are to the right of every single party in Europe on most issues, even the fascists want universal healthcare, housing programs and gun control). It's not just about national elections. I vote several degrees further to the left in our local elections than in the nationals, for reasons similar to why NYC democrats chose Zohran Mamdani, and I feel my votes count in the nationals and the EU elections which doesn't seem to be the case in all states in the US national elections. An other reason I trust our elections more is that there is far better regulation of the money in politics. And that is also a function of the multiparty system. Usually the two or three main parties have most donor money (still far less than in the US). But then if they get too involved with their sponsors, the voters have a choice of voting for some of the minor parties, which has happened many times in my lifetime, both on the left and on the right.

Are there? Trump won the popular vote. The Republicans won control of the House and Senate, and while that's got gerrymandering mixed in, they did also get the most votes when you add up the people who voted R vs D in the House and Senate races. And sure, people will say that not everyone who voted Republican is all in on Fascism, and I'm sure that's true to an extent. But they did all vote for it. They may not be fully committed Fascists, but they're fine with Fascism. I hope the military is a bulwark for democracy. But that's a hell of a thing to depend on. The problem, and both elected Democrats and many just regular people, think that being Not Trump is more than enough reason to vote Democratic. And for me it is. I voted Harris and hoped like he'll she'd win. But. But. Clearly for a majority of Americans simply being Not Trump was not a compelling reason to vote. I agree that for decent people it should be, I agree that in a sane world it should be, I agree thar the people who wouldn't vote Democratic were making a terrible decision and they've inflicted massive harm that may be the end of America. But the undisputable fact remains that for a majority of American simply being Not Trump was an insufficient reason to vote for a Democrat. Whether it should have been, or whether we're angry with them [1], doesn't change the reality tha lt a majority of people looked at Harris and decided that something different, even Fascism, was better. The Democrats should really reflect on that, and what it means that a majority of Americans were so dissatisfied with the status quo and so desperate for anything else, that they'd vote Trump. Unfortunately they haven't. And it looks like they won't. The Democrats would rather rage and scold than consider how utterly, completely, they has failed when Donald Trump looked better to most people.  You have to REALLY fuck up if people think Trump is a better choice. Unfortunately, that reality has been rejected in favor of third way middle of the reading and inaction. The Democrats showed more anger, fire, and action in working to smear Mamdani than they did in working to stop Trump. And that tells us something else horrible: not only did most Americans think Trump was a better choice than the status quo, but our only opposition party is more concerned with protecting zillionaires than it is with winning. If they can't even look at Mamadani's win over their machine picked and endorsed candidate and think maybe, just maybe, they should learn from Mamdani rather than hate him and go to FOX News as smear him, then the Democratic leadership is no where near able to take on Trump. Instead of reflecting on their monumental failure and how deeply unpopular their policy is, the Democrats are committing to more of the same and yelling about people who won't vote for status quo over Trump. And I get it! I want to yell at them too! But that's not winning elections and it's not addressing the fundamental hollowness of the Democratic Party that got us to this point. Not to make an eConOmIC anXiETy argument, but I don't think 50 years of stagnant paychecks is really what you'd call a good thing when you're trying to argue that the status quo is better than the Fascist. I'm able 99% sure that in 2028 Trump will run again, assuming we have elections in 2028. And yes, I know the Constitution says he can't. The Constitution also says he can't deport citizens, strip people of due process, and rearrange the budget on a whim. He's the Republican candidate in 2028 and we all know it. I belithat right this second there is only one person who could actually beat him if the elections are fair: Alexandra Ocasio Cortez, the woman the Democratic machine hates with a passion and does its best to crush and minimize. And that tells us that the Democrats are not equal to the task. But we don't have anyone else and that means I'm not hopeful.  Thus the topic of this thread. TL;DR: however stupid that means people are, simply being Not Trump won't win. Democrats need to get on the ball with something better than merely Not Trump.

They write, ""As you develop your tactics and strategize, it’s important to be aware of the pervasiveness of cynicism among many of those you may be trying to reach. Cynicism is a dominant force in today’s political discourse, with some good reason and a favorite approach of the world’s political hobbyists."" They quote another writer, Eitan Hersh, who calls people who follow and comment on politics without really participating ""political hobbyists"" and Kaba and Hayes continue: ""It is important to understand the distinction between activists, organizers, and political hobbyists. Such hobbyists will often have very strict political standards, either around respectability or radicalism, to which few activists ever seem to rise. If you organize anything political, you are likely to attract the criticism of hobbyists, since for some people, critique is a pastime. Of course, organizers make genuine mistakes that political hobbyists may react to, but the fact is, making mistakes is a consequence of trying. The more you take action, the more errors and missteps you will make along the way. A person who has attempted nothing can easily point to the fact that they have never failed, but what have they built? What have they healed?""",19 favorites,"['https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1922-let-this-radicalize-you?ref=meditationsinanemergency.com', '/favorited/2/8741483']",2025-07-04 11:46:00,Friday

It's...permission for folks that are actively engaged on the ground to make mistakes, and not spend too much precious energy (and I mean that, even the too-small amount of action I engage in is exhausting) worrying about purity tests and criticism that the work isn't perfect. It's politics. The solution is never perfect. How could it be, with so many competing viewpoints and stakeholders? If you are attending protests, working phone banks, writing post cards, or bless you, organizing, thank you, and know your work is appreciated. You are the ones coming to save us. That it isn't happening on someone's preferred timeline is what it is. If you are still on the sidelines, if you are boxed in by your cynicism, if you feel so overwhelmed that everything seems hopeless, welcome to grief. It sucks. But it can get better. Just speaking from my limited personal experience, protesting has been a great turning point for me. It's great to stand with a group of people that share your hope. It's great to hear the honking affirmation of random passers by. I find it both physically exhausting and spiritually recharging. It is the opposite of doom scrolling. It's hope marching. It's possible to trade up from cynicism to hope. Maybe not optimism...let's not get carried away.  It's possible to trade up from isolation to community. Community is where we build trust with each other again, and trust is the key to tackling whatever comes next. This is not a panacea. Everything still sucks, and the forces arrayed against us are still formidable. But the lack of empathy that drives the terrible actions is a weakness that we can exploit over time, and our empathy, though it can overwhelm us during these waves of shitty behavior, is still the key to resilient communities and effective resistance. I have to sign off now, We organized the yearly 4th of July block party, and it's time to start grilling. I can think of no better symbol of hope, at least for today. Two quotes from Mark Twain, on my way out: ""My kind of loyalty was loyalty to one's country, not to its institutions or its officeholders. The country is the real thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing to watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body from winter, disease, and death.""

Not to deny the reasons to despair, but I do see a path out. My fear and worry is simply that the Democrats are incapable of taking it. I'd concede I've been arguing that the Democrats would win more if they promoted more social and economic equality since I first showed up at MeFi, so it should be no surprise at all that's what I see as the way forward. It'll be a struggle, even with full buy in from the Democratic Party. It's always easier to sell the masses on ""that minority is stealing all your money"" than it is to sell them on ""the rich people have stolen all your money"". And Trump has been pushing the anti-minority angle hard. The advantage we have is that ""the rich have stolen all your money"" is true, while ""minorities are invading our country to steal your money"" is false, and eventually all the rhetoric will fail in the face of Trump's economic devastation. My point is that there is a group, a large group, who could vote for Democrats but are simply not motivated to do so by ""we're not Trump"". The turnout for Democrats was lower in 2024 than it was in 2020. And I'm certain some of that was just racism and sexism against Harris, but I think a lot was just pure desperate yearning for something, anything, to change. Or at least an utter disgust with the status quo and those who protect it. They'll keep voting for Fascism if Fascism is what promises the change they want and no one else is making those promises. The victory of Trump in 2016, despite it being an EC only victory, should have been a moment of realization, reflection, and fundamental change among Democrats. When a political party has failed so miserably that even Donald Trump is preferable to their candidate it doesn't mean the electorate is evil, or misguided, or stupid (though many are all three). It means the alternative vision presented by the Democrats was so uninspiring, or even repugnant, to the voters that they'd accept anyone, even Trump, as the alternative. I think Mamdani proves what I've been saying: running on economic and social justice wins! And as someone in a prior thread pointed out, it's not merely that the current Democratic leadership won't change, it's that they can't. Schumer, for example, is simply incapable of being anything but a zillionaire loving center right status quo advocate. That's what he is. So we have to replace them. I'm not saying it's easy, I'm just saying that there is a way out. It's a difficult, uphill, miserable slog of a way out, but it would work. And for those who want to argue that pushing an agenda of more left leaning stuff like social and economic equality and progress won't work, well, what's your alternative? We know, for a stone cold certain fact, that what the Democrats have been doing is a failure. So what do you think they could do differently that isn't leaning more left and arguing for bigger paychecks and lower prices?",9 favorites,['/favorited/2/8741502'],2025-07-04 12:45:00,Friday

It's that, if elected, being Not-Trump would not be good enough to do what America needs a leader to do, other than not be Trump. Joe Biden's campaign essentially boiled down to ""my ass in this seat means Trump's ass can't be in this seat,"" and Biden governed like someone whose intractable ass was the most important part of his presidency. Unfortunately, it was. Unfortunately, while we needed a prophylactic ass, we also needed a masterful intelligence; Biden did not provide that, and the country suffered. As far as the subject at hand goes, I find myself thinking often of how, on the night Obama was elected, ostensible comedian Victoria Jackson tweeted, ""America died,"" and some wit responded, ""Is America what you call your brain?"" (This wasn't that funny, but I still remember it sixteen years later; I can't remember one funny thing Victoria Jackson ever said.) But America had not died, nor had any of the bad parts of it that most Americans thought Obama's election meant were a thing of the past. So one, mourning America just makes us look like Victoria Jackson to the magas, so don't do that.

I think he should have joined a protest instead. Obviously I'm not in his position, and the paralysis and safety bias that decent people develop when they have power isn't entirely a bad thing. But backing down just show them that they can keep killing to keep us shut up. I do hope, very much, that this pushes Walz and the rest of the MN state government to pass a law forbidding any law enforcement agent of any agency from wearing a mask, obscuring their badge, or refusing to identify themselves. Ideally with a proviso that makes it so any person who does wear a mask, an obscured badge, or refuses to identify is legally treated as if they were not a law enforcement agent during that time. Any ""arrest"" they make is prosecuted as kidnapping, they get no state funded legal representation, they lose all qualified immunity, the instant they cover their faces or badges they're legally not police. If he has the power to call a special session to get it passed, he should. It'll never happen, but it's what should happen. For those knowledgeable of the matter, since the MN state lege is in recess for a year (JFC I'd hoped Texas was the only state that had this sort of bullshit) how does the absence of the Speaker shake out? Is there an election between now and then? If Walz does call them in for a special session does it mean the Republicans have a majority due to murder? caviar2d2 It is 100% relevant. In the US right now pigs cover their faces, cover their badges, refuse to identify themselves, and as an entirely predictable consequence of this right now no one knows if the masked person the encounter wearing tactical armor is a cop, a cosplayer, a militia member, just a plain criminal, or what. And thanks to aggressive prosecution for the bullshit crime of ""interfering with an officer of the law"" we must all treat anyone dressed like a pig as if they were one. Expressing doubt, demanding identification, all of that sort of thing is now punishable by 6 years in prison or more. When they stop hiding their faces, stop hiding their badges, and start identifying themselves on demand I will stop calling them pigs. Until then? They're pigs, and every pig who has ever hidden their face, badge, etc is directly responsible for creating an environment where these sorts of assassinations can take place. Just yesterday, Brevard County top pig Wayne Ivey outright said, at a press conference, that he had ordered his fellow pigs to murder any protester they imagined might be breaking a law. The Fascists are portraying him as a hero. They hide their names, badges, and faces, slap Punisher skulls on their cars and gear, they beat the shit out of people for fun, they shoot journalists because they hate freedom and accountability, they murder us, and they all cover up for each other. All of that has produced a contemporary American pig culture which is inseparable from the assassination attempts we just saw. And it will happen again, and again, and again until the pigs are forced to unmask, identify themselves, show their badges, and act like police instead of pigs. In the past few months we have seen people dressed like secret pigs robbing Hispanic people.

They maybe weren't the wittiest signs but I appreciated their local vibe. It's also tourist season and downtown was filled, as is often the case this time of year, with thousands of visitors from many parts of the US as well as other nations, generally deposited in town for a few hours by one of the massive cruise ships that ply the Inside Passage route.  Reaction from the international visitors was interesting.  Some were clearly made nervous by the event and did their best to hurry around it engaging as little as possible.  But many others were curious about the protest and I spent a bit of time explaining the context to some of them. The mood was very positive, protesters were clearly energized, and there was a large amount of support indicated by passing motorists.  Nothing is going to change directly as a result of today's protest but it did leave me feeling as though momentum is building and more individuals are joining our gang of usual suspects to push back",9 favorites,['/favorited/2/8734395'],2025-06-14 21:14:00,Saturday

To purge the filth from my system, I'll share what they've told me I'm astounded (though maybe I shouldn't be) at how rapidly Twitter has collapsed into a hive of far-right insanity. Like, it was never exactly a Roman forum of dudes in togas eloquently articulating principles and positions, but holy smokes, it seems to genuinely have been overrun by reactionaries and fascists. I'm not nearly active enough on it to know if that's because most of the reasonable people have simply given up on it and left since Musk bought it and began actively working to turn it into an engine of reactionary crap. Anyway, I did my best not to make any assumptions about the murderer in this case, if only to avoid having egg on my face if my immediate thoughts were wrong-- which were that this was another far right terrorist, which is exactly what he's shaping up to be (his ""hit list"" was comprised of Democrats, abortion providers, and pro-choice advocates, multiple sources have said he voted for Trump, he was known to be anti-LGBT and conservative). I wish the news sources reporting on this would situate their reporting in the context of the escalating right-wing violence we've been seeing for years. When they report on this, they should also be reminding people that Paul Pelosi was beaten half to death with a hammer by a conspiracy theorist radicalized by years of anti-Nancy Pelosi rhetoric (and that Republicans responded with their usual decorum by making jokes and claiming Paul Pelosi was gay). They should be reminding people that multiple studies have shown that Republicans and Trump supporters are much, much more likely to support political violence, and that right wing terrorism is about a thousand times more common and more destructive than left-wing terrorism. They should be reminding people that Republicans and Trump have constantly normalized violence in American politics. They should not be reporting on this as an isolated incident because it isn't. It's part of a pattern of right wing violence that's only getting worse, and I fear Americans are just not going to understand that unless the media actually does its job and tells them.

There are thousands and thousands of such appointees that any governor is responsible for, and many of them have quite specific requirements. I managed to dredge up the actual Minnesota statute creating the state Workforce Development Board (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/2018/cite/116L.665) . You can see that there are various slots to be filled by various officials and then representatives from various interest groups - everything from employers to small businesses to labor organizations, business organizations, and so on and on. So he might have been involved in some business group - the local Chamber of Commerce or whatever - and been nominated that way, or happens to know a local politician, of either party.  (In a well run state they'll try to keep boards like this non-partisan or bipartisan or whatever.  Anyway the usual issue is finding enough semi-intelligent people willing to put in the free work and unpaid time needed to fill the position, and that will also satisfy the various constituencies interested in the work of that board. Point is, at some point someone on the Governor's staff looked over his application to see if he would be a good fit for this board or whatever.  Somebody or other vouched for him - which could have been anyone from a local politician (state senator or rep from his area, say) to some business group he's involved in. That's about all you can take away from that little bit of info.

Close reading emerged in England in the 1920s among “practical critics” like I.A. Richards and William Empson at Cambridge University, and shortly thereafter in the United States among “New Critics” like Cleanth Brooks, John Crowe Ransom, and Robert Penn Warren. But while Richards and Empson were progressives, most of the New Critics were conservatives, even reactionaries, profoundly influenced by T.S. Eliot’s indictment of modernity and his reevaluation of the canon (demoting John Milton, for example, while elevating John Donne). Key founders of the New Criticism had belonged to the so-called Southern Agrarians, who published a manifesto, I’ll Take My Stand, in 1930, in which they rejected industrial modernity and romanticized the Old South, espousing white supremacy. (In later years, Warren revised his position, publishing a book of interviews with civil rights activists.) : “I have written this book because I wanted to find out something, first hand, about the people (https://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/book) , some of them anyway, who are making the Negro Revolution what it is—one of the dramatic events of the American Story.

https://www.metafilter.com/208854/A-fascinating-anthropology-of-reading,zirconium_encrusted,https://www.metafilter.com/user/344348,"Here is the conclusion of this ponderous article: ""I wondered what other reasons Guillory might have advanced for why we should practice close reading. He might have argued, drawing on his anthropological framing, that it helps a citizenry overcome the difficulty of reading and become more competent at comprehending and interpreting texts. It teaches how to make an argument about a work of art—and how to make a work of art in the process. Close reading, because it begins and ends with a conversation among critics, offers participation in an intellectual community. And my favorite: We should practice close reading because it is good to read for truth and beauty, and even better without the pressure to instrumentalize this goal for economic ends—a criterion, even a paragon, of human flourishing at least since Aristotle, and one that becomes more difficult for students to recognize with each passing year."" Throughout this article there seems the implicit premise that a society of people capable of close reading--whatever it is--is superior to a society of people incapable of close reading. I don't know whether that's true. Surely a society that is hard to bullshit is healthier than a society that is easy to bullshit, but it doesn't look to me on the basis of this article that academic study of English is likely to fortify a society in that way. Look at this paragraph: ""On Close Reading, then, reads like a postscript, a bit that Guillory couldn’t fit into his previous book. But though it is slim, On Close Reading is not slight. In it, Guillory situates close reading in a wide historical, political, and sociological context. Exegetes and interpreters have “read closely”—which is not the same, he argues, as “closely read”—for millennia, from biblical commentators to the “philological and textual” critics of the Renaissance to hermeneuts in the German tradition of Schleiermacher and Gadamer to French practitioners of explication de texte. But in the early 20th century, groups of scholars in England and the United States sought to provide a newly rigorous basis for interpretation, changing how professionals in the Anglophone world read (and still read) today."" This is offered as the background into which the New Criticism is introduced. First Sinykin says that I.A. Richards, and William Empson, under the influence of T.S. Eliot, used what would later be called New Criticism to promote a political attitude that praised the racist antebellum South. Then Sinykin says that Guillory asks us in his book On Close Reading whether we can use the practices of the New Criticism to make progressive arguments. I've tried to write this paragraph several times, but I think shorter is better. So I'll just ask this: who cares whether the practices of the New Criticism can be used to make progressive arguments? Are there people who sincerely believe that critics using the techniques of New Criticism will be able to persuade people to adopt progressive views? What on earth is the hope here? Are we really supposed to take literary criticism of any kind as an instrument of emancipation?",4 favorites,['/favorited/2/8724694'],2025-05-20 05:54:00,Tuesday

I've been thinking about close reading quite a lot in recent months. I'm almost 60, and a lifelong voracious reader. I'm also a writer with decades of experience, and am quite good. I also have a background in literary scholarship, from grad school back in the day, and am currently  working on what is turning into a pretty epic work on Walt Whitman, Queerness, and Quakerism, with a hefty dose of the history of Whitman criticism on both topics. In the last year, I've had the opportunity to take two classes with gay novelist Garth Greenwell, who offers them online. The first was on James Baldwin's first novel, Another Country , and the second was on writing about sex. Both classes blew my mind, not so much because I loved what we were reading, but because Greenwell is an extraordinary teacher, and he teaches by doing close readings. He is extremely gifted at seeing how a writer's word choice, syntax, imagery, and more work to create the effect of the writing. If you've ever thought, ""I know this sentence is really good, but why is it good?"" Greenwell is your go-to for finding an answer. I remember in Joan Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking , she describes her husband, a novelist, walking in their pool, in water up to his waist, reading Sophie's Choice . He'd been reading it more than once in order to ""figure out how it worked."" Reading with Greenwell reminded me of that. He can take a short piece of writing and open it up, and he can also point out how the structure of a longer work, like a novel, is also important, what it's doing, and why it's doing that (or what the author is trying, and sometimes failing, to do). I've always known how to read as a reader , and I've known for decades how to read as a scholar , but I feel like Greenwell has been teaching me how to read as a writer , in a way no other teacher, in my MFA program or in books they've written, or in my other undergraduate and graduate education, has been able to do. The 20th Century critics were trying to develop a method to more accurately and, maybe, objectively evaluate texts, but Greenwell puts close reading to a very different purpose, something like better understanding the work on its own terms, and admiring the writer's craft and artistry. I adore learning from Greenwell and will do it again, even if he's teaching books I don't care for. I don't love Greenwell's own novels, though I recognize they're very good. I didn't care for most of what was in the Kink anthology he edited with R. O. Kwan, either. Greenwell and I have very different taste in books.

https://www.metafilter.com/208854/A-fascinating-anthropology-of-reading,Saxon Kane,https://www.metafilter.com/user/71654,"it seemed like the field was a bit of a pyramid scheme. Find students who were good at picking apart literature and convince them to go to grad school. Why? So they could be literature professors. So, that's not a pyramid scheme. That's how every endeavor in human history operates: find people who seem skilled at a task, train them, and then they train the next generation. To be a pyramid scheme, professors would have to get a kickback from their former grad students, like if I paid my dissertation advisor $5 per student I taught. Seemingly no thought was given to the fact that the world needs a finite number of literature professors This is silly. You could replace ""literature professors"" with any other profession and it'd be just as true, and just as meaningless. The world needs only a finite number of historians, engineers, doctors, lawyers, dentists, farmers, custodians, bankers, accountants, etc. etc. Yes, there are many more PhDs in (name a field) than there are jobs for that field, and maybe that means that there's too many people in that field, or maybe it means that capitalism steers money towards things that can be monetized and away from endeavors that offer other sorts of value. a PhD in English doesn't qualify you for anything else. This is also a dumb thing to say, and frankly, a bit insulting to people, like myself, who have pursued advanced degrees in the humanities -- or, any other field. And again, you could replace ""English"" with any other field, and the statement would still be as ignorant. What does a PhD in English (or history, or anthropology, or whatever) prepare you for? Well, besides the subject matter expertise, people working in higher ed do a lot of other kinds of work: tracking multiple performance statistics on dozens, sometimes hundreds of students a semester; managing and advising students on projects, which can include multi-year, multi-person research projects; conducting extensive reviews of academic programs and productivity; organizing conferences and other academic and para-academic events; fundraising and outreach, including partnering with businesses to set up student internships; working on all sorts of committees responsible for everything from student retention to budgetary concerns to on-campus parking to on-campus safety to etc. etc. etc. There are a whole host of what people like to call ""transferable skills"" involved in being a PhD in English (or whatever); it doesn't just mean that you know a lot about books. The Humanities are a wonderful idea in theory but it's clear we are living in inhumane times and they haven't helped us much, practically. I don't even know what this means. What would be a ""practical"" measure of how ""the humanities"" help, or don't? Does the mere existence of ""inhumane"" behavior somehow prove that ""the humanities"" are pointless? Or does perhaps the fact that there are people who try to assert the value of the humanities in the face of the inhumanity of the world perhaps demonstrate that they ARE valuable? And that maybe the constant erosion of the humanities in favor of profit-oriented ventures is part of the problem? I mean, would you say ""Environmentalism is a wonderful idea in theory, but it's clear we are living in a time of environmental destruction and it hasn't helped us much, practically""? Does the prevalence of environmental destruction prove that we should ditch environmentalism, or maybe instead that we need it even more now than ever ? In a previous thread you said that the humanities are a ""self-congratulatory dead-end"" -- a statement that, again, is more than a bit offensive. Because of course, that's why I did my PhD, so I could congratulate myself. Not because I wanted to help others expand their perspectives and learn about how other people live and see the world. Not because I love stories and want to share those stories with other people. Not because I wanted to help students to learn to think deeply about the stories they are told about how the world works. Not because I wanted to try to make some small contribution to the body of human knowledge. Nope, it was all self-congratulatory, I guess. I get the sense that maybe you had some real asshole professors back when you were an English major and are still carrying a chip on your shoulder because of that. Maybe I'm wrong, but your dismissal of a huge swath of human knowledge is just... disappointing. an effort to hijack the term ""close reading"" to mean something very narrow and peculiar to the 20th century and after, and not an attempt to talk about any kind of generally useful insights about cognition and how people process written/printed text. Well, the article isn't about ""cognition"" or about ""how people process written/printed text."" It's specifically about the development of a set of professional practices in the field of literary study. And as a term of art, ""close reading"" does have a specifically 20th century meaning, as the article notes that ""the term gained currency in the late 1960s, right as the New Criticism fell out of favor, and was used by its enemies to describe its method."" So yeah, you can use ""close reading"" as a generic term to mean ""pay attention"" or ""focus on the details,"" but as a technical term within literary studies -- which is the subject of the article -- it has particular associations that differentiate it from, say, the kinds of philological research performed by a biblical scholar in the 19th century",9 favorites,['/favorited/2/8725029'],2025-05-20 16:55:00,Tuesday

But I feel like academia is the worst method to accomplish that. It costs SO MUCH and as you get more education you tend to study smaller and smaller slices of things, to a ridiculous degree. Publishing is a rigged game, and who gets read (and then who gets studied) is about a lot of things that don't necessarily have to do with literary merit. Learning to write clearly, communicate clearly, and learning to think critically are vitally important for everyone. But studying literature is not the same thing, and I think the mixed focus of English departments is confusing for students. I had some awful professors and some good ones, and I'm glad I can pick out the fart jokes in Moby Dick, but for most English majors it's kind of like burning a truckload of money. It's not something someone should go into debt for. Ideally, college should be a time for students to pursue their own learning and interests without regard to future job prospects. And for rich kids, talented kids, and kids whose parents are professors, it can be that. But it's not a level playing field and higher education is too often predatory. I'm glad your experience has been different.

A worker has only their labor to sell, so if you are paid the same for less hours you are getting a better deal. If productivity goes up, but wages stay the same (as they have in America for the last 40+ years), that is a wealth transfer to the capitalist (which by definition is stolen wealth from the worker).  Over those 40+ years trillions of dollars have exited the pockets of workers and ended up in the hands of people like Elon Musk....we all know how that is playing out. The talk used to always be about shorter working hours, but capitalists must see the number go up, so if all your employees are becoming a lot more productive you can increase your wealth by still making them work longer hours, its just greed. With a much more fair distribution of the wealth generated by our society all of us could be working 2-3 days a week and enjoying very satisfying lives.  Instead we chase an ever receding goal of ""enough to get by"" in a system that is designed to never let ""enough"" happen, mostly so someone who is already staggeringly rich, can get more so. Demanding shorter working weeks, for the same amount of pay, just re-balances the scales.  It also leaves time for us lowly workers to do things like be with family, develop community, get educated, have hobbies and experience nature, all of which have been shown to promote anti-consumerist behavior.  So working less, helps you build a society where working less is valued. For tasks and jobs that require someone to be there every day, or require lots of time to do, you simply hire more workers and have them work in shifts, this also help folks who can only work part time, or who are unemployed find income generating work. The reason this has not caught on like wildfire is because it takes money away from the capitalist at the top of the firm, and redistributes it to the worker, and right now workers do no have the huge amount of political power needed to get this kind of thing passed. So in the mean time, you should all be forming unions at your place of work, because that is the first step towards a better future in which we all work a lot less",110 favorites,['/favorited/2/8723589'],2025-05-16 03:53:00,Friday

"" Sure, I'm sure there are many, but I can talk about the industry I work in, which is the film industry. On-set work, that is, actually filming, is an obvious one, schedules are usually as tight as they can be, but I'm not really talking about that. I own a small postproduction company. Most of the tasks we do, like conform, color correction, etc., require a certain amount of time to do, it's a certain number of tasks to do on each cut of the film, for instance, and each of those tasks takes a certain amount of time, it's hard to make it faster (although improved tools occasionally help). VFX work, for instance, is similar, the only way to get things done faster is to add more people or make people work longer hours (a well-known problem in that particular industry). I imagine this is the case for many people who I would call artisans, like, say, mechanics. If you want to take a car engine apart and put it back together, that's probably not a task you can decide to do in 12% less time. Sure, you can take fewer breaks, but then you're just working harder with less rest, which is probably not great to do for 7 hours a day either, I think a few breaks during the working day are pretty essential to reset your brain (and your body in many cases). So again, I'm not saying this isn't good, I'm just skeptical about the ""there was no change in productivity"" claim. I think that might be very true for some kinds of jobs, but not others. I'm sure middle managers, administrators, and all sorts of ""bullshit"" jobs might have no productivity loss when working shorter hours, and since I myself work in roles analogous to ""project manager"", I'm including my own job in the definition of ""bullshit jobs"", but I think people who actually make things, repair things, produce stuff, will necessarily see some productivity loss from working fewer hours. (An extension of this, of course, is that there has to be some kind of optimal number of hours per week to work. There's certainly loss in productivity per hour when people work longer hours and more hours per week, as they get tired, need more breaks, or just get fed up and annoyed, but I also don't think we could reduce the number of working hours per week to, say, 1, and get the same productivity. So the question is, what is that number? It's probably different for different types of jobs too.)",6 favorites,"['https://www.metafilter.com/208791/An-Exemplum#8723647', '/favorited/2/8723715']",2025-05-16 11:39:00,Friday

You can't just do all the things you used to do in 40 hours, in 36 hours! How can it be that there was no loss of productivity anywhere""? I've spent my life, and have lived in a household, where all the income is brought in by actual making of things to be sold, and performing services for money. These aren't weird, off the wall occupations. There is every incentive, at all levels, to perform these occupations as efficiently as possible, because performing more efficiently, means more work, taking more time, and consequently, more income. There is no way the number of goods currently being made in 40 hours can be made in 36. So a cut in hours means less stuff to sell. And there's no way to perform those services in less time, without compromising performance and client satisfaction. And it's not for lack of trying. Not only are we incentivized to increase efficiency, many co employees are paid to find ways to improve efficiency, a thing that does happen, generally incrementally. Which is welcomed, because demand for these goods and services has remained high. Not to mention hourly workers, who would obviously take a hit with a reduced work week. For tasks and jobs that require someone to be there every day, or require lots of time to do, you simply hire more workers and have them work in shifts, this also help folks who can only work part time, or who are unemployed find income generating work. Once again, I don't want to rag on any particular user, but have you ever run a business? Are there folks here who think they're the only ones who've ever thought of this? the only way to get things done faster is to add more people or make people work longer hours (a well-known problem in that particular industry).

Unless you are performing the sort of complex surgery that requires a single surgeon to perform for 8 or 9 hours at a time, there are very, very few workplace situations that can't be broken into multiple tasks or multiple roles, or performed over multiple days. Even the example of making a thing, almost all output can be done by two people, if that output must be done in a continuos block of time. And if you are talking creative works? I'm sorry friend, your creative output is going to start faltering after nine solid hours at the canvas/tablet/keyboard/whatever. Shorter days are more productive because there is less time wasted to burnout and fatigue. Speaking as a creative, you need less slog and more recovery time to be productive than you think you do. It truly boggles the mind that people here can't get their head around the idea that for almost all industry productivity improves when employees aren't stressed to hell and back, tired, and overworked. And I would implore the Single Unit American Worker, alienated from their own labor so badly they can't see where the task starts and the yoke ends, to maybe believe the entire ass rest of the world when we say actually no, you can be just as good, if not better, if you take a lunch break and have a holiday here and there and tell your boss to stick it if he calls you out of hours. You don't have to do the same things in 36 hours as you do in 40, because a lot of that remaining four hours is just...fucking suffering dude. Broken up into a five day week, it represents the half hour to an hour spread out over the day when you sit at your desk or behind your damn till or whatever wishing you'd run away with the circus like you wanted to do when you were five. It's the ten minute toilet break you spend desperately scanning Linkdin for a better job, or the half hour meeting that is entirely spent going ""is your mike on"" with people on the other side of the country who have their screens off so they can eat their lunch at their desk without horrifying people with their gross biological needs. It's filling out stupid paperwork that Iceland automated, it's drafting meaningless emails as a form of call and reply, making sure everyone's in the office. It's being so tired you forget your password and have to reset it, or the cheap chair that keeps dropping you so you have to reset. Like I'm using office examples because retail and service is coverage, and they already love to put people on weird schedules. Medicine (and the busy end, not admin) is understaffed because skilled people are hard to find, and they work shit hours for want of staff, not because some Puritanical manager has decided everyone needs X hours to count as a Moral and Productive member of society. 36 hour work weeks are pretty common in Australia, where I am. So are 38s. We have a bunch of industries that do rotating rosters, so you'll have two days on, four days off, or other weird arrangements for things like firefighters and other emergency services personel. It's really common for retail for even a full time worker to do 36 over seven days, with the days off arranged to suit the business or the employer, depending on who has better bargaining power. I had a nurse friend who used to do three 12 hour shifts through his agency, then have four days off. Like all these weird not 40 hour things work because realistically, sit-in-one-play-do-work is the outlier and the weird one. It's not even a 'here is a specific set of tasks that miraculously take eight hours to accomplish', it's just fill the day with whatever's going, and that works just as well for a six hour day, and everyone is less burned out at the end. I mean are you even listening to yourselves? Do you even want to take four seconds to reflect on the absurdity of suggesting that by some fluke of nature, every employee magically has a specific set of tasks that must be done in an exact eight hour block, for five days a week for the rest of their lives? The majority of workers are engaged in cutting a length of string, metaphorically speaking, that they have become accustomed to cutting at eight hours and that could just as easily be cut at six.

If a particular job needs to be completed by one person and needs full eight-hour days to do it, then fine, take those eight-hour days. If it needs five working days to complete, then do four of them in week one and the fifth at the start of week two. Where's the harm? There's a deadline? Who set it, and why? Nobody is going to die if your magazine article is filed next Monday rather than on Friday. If timeliness is so crucial and one specific person has to work that extra day, perhaps we could start paying it as overtime and see how crucial it really is. Large-scale creative projects like movies have a whole team of people which could, if needed, be scaled, or the project could be drawn out. Maybe that movie doesn't get released in time for the summer; maybe it gets released in September. Maybe it doesn't hit Christmas, and it comes out next summer. Who's really harmed? Fans might have to wait in suspense a little longer, if it's the latest instalment of a franchise; and the movie studio might have to wait a bit longer before they start making bank. Ahh, there's the rub. The people bankrolling it won't be able to make as much bank as if they'd worked everyone as hard as possible to hit tight artificial deadlines. Sounds like capitalism in action. Sounds like one of the ways we chase after economic growth to deliver profits to the rich. We know that chasing perpetual growth is killing the planet. All of our productivity is producing nothing but problems for our children. And we know that this way of chasing after growth produces problems for regular working people, who have less time with their children or for themselves in the only life they'll ever get. There are places in the world that don't do this. Go to a poorer tropical country, and you'll hear people talk of ""[country's name] time"", the extra time it takes to get anything done there. Bureaucratic tasks take days or weeks longer than they would in hyper-efficient countries. Buildings don't go up overnight, and aren't as big when they do. You need to adjust your expectations. People aren't as ""productive"". They aren't as rich. Western countries used to be like this. Cathedrals took a century to build. It took longer to get places. There weren't cars or trains, there were horses, or you had to walk. If you wanted to visit New York from London, you got on a ship. It was all less productive. It was also less destructive to the planet. There are things about modern society that we won't want to give up in returning to a simpler, less productive time for the sake of the environment, such as modern technology, or modern medicine. We'll want to make changes carefully. It's escaping nobody's notice, though, that one of the richest countries on the planet is giving up both of those, via tariffs and putting a whackjob in charge of health, in pursuit of entrenching and enriching one man and his hangers-on.

And finally, people leaving due to burnout is a maaaasssive loss of knowledge and experience, usually impacting things far more than a decrease of 10% of working hours. Yes, there's a point of diminishing returns, but we already know from multiple studies that in most industries, people working 60hours don't get any more done than people working 40 hours, because of those mounting inefficiencies.

Who wouldn’t prefer to work less? What may be unexpected is how much success organizations are seeing with this model. We ask them to rate the success of the trials, and they give consistently high scores—an average of 8.2 out of 10. After a year, only 20 companies, less than 10% of the total, decided to discontinue their four-day week. We also saw excellent results in performance metrics such as revenue, absenteeism and resignations. The bottom line is that the four-day week has been a huge win for the companies. The philosophy of the four-day-week trials is that companies can maintain 100% of their performance despite 20% less time at the workplace. With a little help, most of the companies figure out productivity hacks. The most common is to cut down on meetings... Most of the companies in our trials are white-collar organizations, where eliminating meetings and other distractions goes a long way toward making a four-day week feasible. In industries such as manufacturing and construction, time savings are more likely to be found by making the flow of work more efficient through process engineering... This innovation is what people call a win-win. Economists generally don’t believe in those, so the idea behind today’s four-day-week movement—that there’s a way to benefit workers that also benefits management and owners—is highly implausible in the world of conventional economics...

https://www.metafilter.com/208617/Australian-Federal-Election-2025,jjderooy,https://www.metafilter.com/user/96460,"One bit of context for non-Aussies that I'd forgotten - Australia uses compulsory preferential voting.  This is a contrast to UK/Canadian 'first past the post'.   Australian voters need to rank every candidate on their ballot paper - ie express their preferences. For a candidate to win a lower house seat, they need to win 50 per cent of the votes in their electorate, where the votes of less popular candidates are transfered according to the voter's preference.  It's not unusual for a candidate to secure the most first preferences, but then not win the seat as the preferences from a range of candidates coallese around their opponent. Meanwhile, each of Australia's six states elect six senators, and our two territories two each.  To be elected, a state senator needs to win a quota of 14.3% (1/6 of the vote, plus 1), with their excess votes distributed (its complicated).  As a result, Australian states tend to return two or three Senators for each of the two major party groupings, plus a minor party rep or independent, although this is changing over time. This is a really good resource (https://www.aec.gov.au/election/voting.htm#start) for those interested in how Australian elections work",7 favorites,"['https://www.aec.gov.au/election/voting.htm#start', '/favorited/2/8718340']",2025-05-01 18:17:00,Thursday

https://www.metafilter.com/208617/Australian-Federal-Election-2025,dg,https://www.metafilter.com/user/14179,"Some may be interested in how Australians actually cast their vote.  As the post mentions, there are two components of the election - the house and the senate.  For each, voters fill out a ballot paper using provided pencils (you can bring your own pencil or pen) but, no, nobody is erasing your votes (https://www.aec.gov.au/media/disinformation-register-2025.htm) .  Because Australia uses preferential voting, voters must identify not only their first choice, but their order of preference for (house voting) all candidates and (senate voting) for at least twelve candidates if choosing to cast votes for individual candidates or at least six party/group candidates.  Voting for the house is relatively straightforward, with nine candidates in my electorate (https://www.aec.gov.au/election/candidates.htm?suburb=Carrara&division=Moncrieff&state=QLD) , one of whom is elected for a three-year term.  When voting for the senate, there are often much larger numbers, 56 in my electorate, six of whom are elected for a six-year term.  Here's what the house (https://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/How_to_Vote/Voting_HOR.htm) and senate (https://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/How_to_Vote/Voting_Senate.htm) ballot papers look like. All elections are conducted by the independent statutory authority, the Australian Electon Commission (https://www.aec.gov.au/) (as noted in the post) and all counting is one by an army of temporary employees of the AEC, with parties allowed to have one official observer at each polling place.  The AEC also determines the boundaries of each electorate (https://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/) .  These are reviewed one year after each new government is elected - some detail and other interesting facts here (https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_8_-_Elections_for_the_House_of_Representatives#:~:text=One%20year%20after%20a%20new,and%20territory%20is%20entitled%20to.) . Counting of votes (https://www.aec.gov.au/media/2025/04-30a.htm) (including pre-poll and postal votes) does not start until polls have closed.  That is, each polling place starts counting votes cast there at 6:00 pm, so eg votes are being counted in Queensland two hours before polls close in Western Australia, but the process is slow and no reporting would occur except in very remote areas before all polls have closed.  The army of temporary AEC staff (around 100,000 on election day), having resided over the poll all day, then start counting and must remain at the polling place until the counting has been completed.  I've worked at polling places a few times and it can be a long day - I've done well in excess of 12-hour days before. When voters arrive at the polling place, they provide their name and address and are crossed off in a register of voters for that electorate.  Yes, this is done using paper books of voters and their name crossed out by hand every time by a polling place staff member.  They are given their ballot papers and directed to the voting booths - cardboard temporary booths set up by the AEC staff.  Ballots are placed into sealed ballot boxes (cardboard), overseen by a ballot box guard.  I've done that job and it's generally rotated through the staff because it's so boring and frustrating.  I wish I had a dollar for every time someone asked me where to put their house ballot if they don't want to vote for The Greens, because the house ballots are printed on green paper and the ballot box says 'place green ballots here'. The counting process is tedious and exacting, with ballots being emptied from the ballot boxes onto a table, flattened out (special thanks to the dickheads who think folding their ballot into a tiny square is funny), checked for correctness (any ballot not properly filled out or with anything written on the ballot is considered 'informal' and not counted - one of the weird things about compulsory voting is that you don't actually have to cast a vote, but you do have to turn up at a polling place and put your ballot paper in the box - I have seen people get their ballot and walk straight to the box and put it in unmarked).  As ballots are checked, they get placed into piles for each candidate, collated and counted.  This is not too onerous for the house ballots (about A5 size or a bit smaller), but the senate ballots can be about the size of three A4 pages placed end-to-end.  The person in charge of the polling place collects all the counted ballots and they go into sealed boxes for further counting, because only the first preference is counted on the night of voting.  Where there is not a clear winner from first preferences, second preferences are counted later and sometimes third preferences and beyond of the vote does not exceed 50% for one candidate.  It can take days or even weeks to arrive at a final count in close races. The counting process is complicated by the presence of political party representatives observing the count (they can't touch the ballot papers) - they can challenge any vote if they believe it is wrongly counted or should be considered or not considered 'informal'.  Mostly, they are pretty reasonable but can be finicky if they think the count will be close. It all sounds very antiquated and cumbersome and it is.  But it works pretty well and it's not like we have to do it every week",16 favorites,"['https://www.aec.gov.au/media/disinformation-register-2025.htm', 'https://www.aec.gov.au/election/candidates.htm?suburb=Carrara&division=Moncrieff&state=QLD', 'https://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/How_to_Vote/Voting_HOR.htm', 'https://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/How_to_Vote/Voting_Senate.htm', 'https://www.aec.gov.au/', 'https://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/', 'https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_8_-_Elections_for_the_House_of_Representatives#:~:text=One%20year%20after%20a%20new,and%20territory%20is%20entitled%20to.', 'https://www.aec.gov.au/media/2025/04-30a.htm', '/favorited/2/8718351']",2025-05-01 18:45:00,Thursday

Both of the parties in the arrangement like to maintain the fiction that they are completely independent, but in reality it is extremely rare that the senior partner (Libs) ever gets enough seats to govern in their own right. The Nationals will never govern in their own right. They also like to run shameless scare campaigns against Labor about the possibility that Labor might have to govern as a minority government and rely on votes from the Greens.

As a result, Australian states tend to return two or three Senators for each of the two major party groupings, plus a minor party rep or independent, although this is changing over time. Senators (upper house of review) are elected on a state/territory wide proportional basis, and Representatives (lower house, where government is formed) are elected on a more localised basis in individual seats within each state/territory. There are 12 senators from each state, with 6 year terms. However, they are elected on a staggered basis, with half of them being up for grabs each election. The senators from the two territories only get the same 3 year term as the as the lower house (Representative, i.e. Reps), and have to face the electorate at every election. Also, having only two senators the quota for those two jurisdictions is 33.33% plus one vote. My prediction is the Labor government gets returned, possibly with more seats, and a more generally favourable parliament overall (mainly as the emerging new moderate centre-right force, the informal group calling themselves the Teals, are likely to pick up seats courtesy of the more moderate conservative voters abandoning the increasingly hard right Trumpian-style Coalition)",3 favorites,['/favorited/2/8718357'],2025-05-01 18:58:00,Thursday

Through 2024 and into early 2025 they looked likely to coast into power as the cost-of-living bit across the country. But being stuck in the global-right-wing bubble does them no favours in Australia, where the compulsory and preferential voting system tends to reward those who tack towards the political centre, and a defined campaign filtered through media forces attention to detail rather than vibes. Trying to draw on Trumpian ideas backfired badly when Australians started to see the chaos of such thinking, and culturally we're a little less keen overall (not to say we don't have our own right-wingers) on engaging in culture wars and punching down on public servants, women, Indigenous Australians, and the like. Meanwhile,  a slow economic turnaround and a fair bit of success in gradual reform across several policy areas saw the Labor government have a story to tell that made them seem re-electable.  Australians are fairly aware of the world, and seemed to recognise that the cost of living crisis was not something that the Australian Government could uniquely be blamed for or solve. Broadly, the Green, teal and independent members elected in 2022 have been successful in ensuring their profile, even if they haven't been in government.  Some are the most trusted and highly visible politicians in the country, and many have shown a strong sense of the pulse of their communities and a high quality non-ideological commitment to integrity and good policy. The big question is the eventual makeup of the Parliament.  Polls don't help us because the decline of the two party system means many many seats are in play with multiple possible outcomes. My hope is for an emboldened progressive Labor government - either with a workable majority and a PM thinking about legacy;  or a minority Labor government that's pushed and agile enough to be more true to its traditional progressive values and less nervous about Australia's big-business rent-seekers.  In the case of the former - Albo started off as a traditional leftie, and I'd hope he can add to his general incrementalism delivering something really important.  In the case of the latter,  a minority Labor government has recent experience in working with a smaller cross-bench from the 2010-13 Gillard government and can own the stuff that works while blaming the cross-bench for anything that goes wrong",8 favorites,['/favorited/2/8718382'],2025-05-01 20:09:00,Thursday

I'd like to persuade you to another opinion of our AEC-driven system beyond antiquated and cumbersome. Free and fair elections are the most important activities a citizen can participate in. Good systems require detail, patience and accuracy. It is 'old' because it is tried and tested and found to be a solid system. It is comprised of many moving parts so each element can be, and be seen to be , enacted with diligence and honesty. As you note, the votes don't leave the polling booth until they are counted and recorded, to be later counted again at least once, with oversight by AEC staff and party scrutineers during the counts. Sustained successful outcomes require appraised and refined systems. In this case, the most simple tools - pencils, paper, cardboard, community halls and vetted casual staff - are the most efficient, transparent and trustworthy. There are no Dominion-style companies involved, no private enterprise interests. Almost everybody has the opportunity to apply to work as a casual AEC staff member on election days, so it's not an exclusive club of workers. It really is active citizenry in practice. I voted pre-poll late last week because I am out of my electorate, having moved but not yet settled. In my old electorate, a comedian, writer, community activist and mother of five, Mandy Nolan (https://greens.org.au/nsw/person/mandy-nolan) who won the popular vote but lost on preferences to the Labor incumbent last election, may win all the way this time with a solid footing gained from her ongoing community engagement, and the successful door knocking strategies the Greens have used in winnable seats to good effect. In my new electorate, I voted for another comedian, Alex Dyson (https://www.alexdysonindependent.com/) second, then reverse numbered the shit parties on the list (the Coalition, Family First, Trumpet of Patriots, One Nation) with the Coalition incumbent last, Labor (shit lite) up near the top, and the Greens first. The Greens won't win this seat but I want them to get the electoral funding of @$4 for my vote, and for my vote to flow to Dyson who is out-polling the incumbent Coalition member, and is likely to win. If Dyson win's on Greens preferences overall, it will show him that a major part of his support base has Green concerns and hopefully he'll act accordingly.

To my way of thinking, this reflects a fundamental mistake that the whole world has been making on climate policy, largely as a result of lobbying efforts by the oil industry. The main driver of climate change is not and never has been emissions as such; it is and always has been the de-sequestering of fossil carbon, moving it out of the slow planetary carbon cycle (https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle/page1.php) and into the fast cycle. Oil, gas, coal, limestone. Obviously humanity digs this stuff out in far fewer places than we burn it. Obviously that would be the less complex thing to track and regulate. Obviously doing the accounting that way would create much less wiggle room for loopholes and boondoggles. And obviously directly attacking and/or innovating away present-day extractive industries would interrupt the revenue streams of many more billionaires than any of today's essentially ineffective (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/bluemoon/co2_400/mlo_full_record.png) emissions-mitigation strategies do. Emissions are a distraction. National commitments to reduce in-country emissions even as fossil carbon extraction continues to accelerate are essentially a scaled-up version of consumer commitments to reduce the use of plastic drinking straws. Exactly the same kind of misapplied responsibility is in play, but the public doesn't see it; the general sense is that if we're ""doing our bit"" on emissions , that's all we need to do. And Australia has been doing its bit on emissions, as a direct result of Labor energy policy, for the last three years. Arguably (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-IzM6XtF58) we'd have been doing our bit on emissions for longer than that had the Greens not blocked Kevin Rudd's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, but really until the world gets serious about shutting down fossil carbon extraction it's all just rearranging deckchairs",5 favorites,"['https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle/page1.php', 'https://scripps.ucsd.edu/bluemoon/co2_400/mlo_full_record.png', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-IzM6XtF58', '/favorited/2/8718723']",2025-05-02 19:06:00,Friday

I started grieving for my country on that day. Haven't really stopped. These days I'm just content to see Greens numbers growing as the Nationals continue to shrink. I do hope to see a formal Labor-Greens coalition before shuffling off this mortal coil, but I no longer believe that the Australian public is capable of educating itself to the point where environmental and equity concerns actually dominate the national debate. Just look at how hard we punished Shorten for daring to suggest ending negative gearing",6 favorites,['/favorited/2/8718742'],2025-05-02 20:40:00,Friday

The Greens can do nothing much about this as any attempt from them to move toward the centre on policy to attract more voters will be blocked by their hard left/environmental factions. So the Greens will either have to accept their status quo, or a split into hard left and moderate left factions, or accept losing their moderate left voters to Labor. However they choose they are not going to expand their presence in parliament much more without running into that hard numbers problem.

There is simply no way to make the general public care enough to understand enough fast enough to get it done any other way. Given the massive amounts of insolation available on this continent we're extremely well placed to create both a huge first-mover advantage and a position of global influence by remaking ourselves as the Saudi Arabia of sunshine. If we overbuild solar PV to the extent that electricity literally is too cheap to meter, we could make arbitrary amounts of green hydrogen at well under the cost of steam-reformed methane, and use that to turn our world-leading exports of iron ore into world-leading exports of high quality steel at a lower end use cost than what comes out of today's Chinese blast furnaces.

Sure, it's part of a flight to stability and ""safe hands"". But as much as the Liberals are unable to uncook themselves,  the Greens seem to be unable to transform themselves from a single issue protest party, into a mainstream option that could take over as the second party if the Liberals totally disintegrate. They've done a bad job of being ""safe hands"". There's certainly a lot of traditional left wing splitting and factionalism in there. Lydia Thorpe being expelled was damaging.  Somehow Labor avoided similar damage from Fatima Payman leaving. I guess Payman wasn't getting into fights outside of nightclubs - and also the cold-hearted Labor analysts were probably secretly happy they could shift to the right again by symbolically shedding Gaza and Palestine activism along with Payman. They get criticised from everywhere trying to develop a complete platform - and it starts with ""How come the Greens never talk about the environment any more?"" Coming out with a defence policy I think is a watershed moment, but maybe not in a good direction. Housing has been an area they've taken up, but Labor has been able to somewhat match them - being able to point to the Victorian state Labor government, which is generating a wonderful flow of landlord tears and ragequits as property investors sell up and move interstate, and a genuinely damped down property market by Australian standards. And what are the Greens left with after that? LGBT+ issues, free Palestine, and a dental plan. Not even legal weed, the Legalise Cannabis party had freaking billboards around Sydney this time! Actually, the right-wing media has been trying so ridiculously hard to smear the Labor party as gay space communists, they might have inadvertently done a good job of highlighting Labor as ""progressive enough"" and helped them steal some of the Green's thunder? The Teal independents have captured the imagination of the ""tree Tory"" Bob Brown older voting bloc. And they've avoided any public disagreements among themselves by refusing to be seen as a new party. ""We're all independents just out for our own local people"". They'll have to face that eventually though",2 favorites,['/favorited/2/8718962'],2025-05-03 16:43:00,Saturday

Centre right in our case, centre left in Labor's case. But you can't make the voters move to you, on the political spectrum. You actually have to fish where the fishes are. There's no point in saying to the voters, ""You're wrong about that, you need to move to the right."" Or in the case of the Left, ""you need to move to the left."" Because they say ""We don't, actually, and we're not going to."" So the Liberal Party needs to understand that if they're going to win elections, they have to say and do things that the public want. Which is pretty much their whole problem. The Liberal Party's entire reason to exist is to look after the interests of the wealthy, and the public is showing real signs of waking up to the idea that in 2025 it's not really about the Left vs Right identity politics promoted by Sky News in its culture wars, it's about obscenely wealthy families using the funds their favoured flavour of fiscal policy has been funnelling their way for forty years to fuck the rest of us forever.

Let me do a bit of quote here:  ""This new ideology is already here. I call it techlordism, a mutation of transhumanism – a creed that advocates blurring the lines between organic and synthetic until augmented humans achieve genuine freedom, or even immortality. Just as neoliberalism borrowed from classical liberalism but usurped it by adding a divinity (the infallible market), techlordism makes itself useful to cloud capital’s three-pronged colonization drive by replacing the neoliberal Homo Economicus with an amorphous 'HumAIn' (a human-AI continuum).""  (for the purposes of this comment, let's ignore how dumb that portmanteau is.) And let me place Brad Smith's bit here:  ""Foucault argued that at the center of their thought was a notion of the individual as a Homo economicus who pursues his rational self-interest (this point itself was nothing new) and who is, therefore, 'manipulable' and 'governable' through modifications of his incentives."" I think that at some point neoliberalism replaces the idea of everyone as homo economicus--that we're a species driven by rational self-interest--with the idea that there is a race of really smart billionaires who are driven by rational self-interest, while the rest of us are slaves of drives and appetites that can be manipulated.  The extent to which we are irrational is the extent to which the true homo economicus is entitled or obligated to punish us for our folly; their means may include the state, but the state itself is sclerotic, slow; better to employ a techno-panopticon free of democratic constraints. (Another way to say this is that the Musk/Trump reconfiguration of neoliberalism excludes your sense of your self-interest from the equation.  You will suffer; a brighter day approaches.  There's nothing you can do.  It's a much older story.) I think this must be true because neoliberal ideology never made any sense. We had to be lectured, over and over, that releasing the manacles that bound the rich was necessary for our own freedom, our own prosperity.  A philosophy that believes in itself doesn't require a massive propaganda campaign; it convinces through its own arguments.  We've had forty years since Foucault, and in that time neoliberalism has become free-floating, unmoored from its genealogy.  It seeks to cut off its own roots, emerging as a notion about power unconstrained by its former philosophy",5 favorites,"['https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/technofeudalist-ideology-emerging-from-neoliberal-rubble-by-yanis-varoufakis-2025-04', '/favorited/2/8717926']",2025-04-30 13:20:00,Wednesday

We have been in a similar moment of shifting coalitions before. In the 1850s, elite southern enslavers organized to take over the government and create an oligarchy that would make enslavement national. Northerners hadn’t been paying a great deal of attention to southern leaders’ slow accumulation of power and were shocked when Congress bowed to them and in 1854 passed a law that overturned the Missouri Compromise that had kept slavery out of the West. The establishment of slavery in the West would mean new slave states there would work with the southern slave states to outvote the North in Congress, and it would only be a question of time until they made slavery national. Soon, the Slave Power would own the country. Northerners of all parties who disagreed with each other over issues of immigration, finance, and internal improvements—and even over the institution of slavery—came together to stand against the end of American democracy. Four years later, in 1858, Democrat Stephen Douglas complained that those coming together to oppose the Democrats were a ragtag coalition whose members didn’t agree on much at all. Abraham Lincoln, who by then was speaking for the new party coalescing around that coalition, replied that Douglas “should remember that he took us by surprise—astounded us—by this measure. We were thunderstruck and stunned; and we reeled and fell in utter confusion. But we rose each fighting, grasping whatever he could first reach—a scythe—a pitchfork—a chopping axe, or a butcher's cleaver. We struck in the direction of the sound; and we are rapidly closing in upon him. He must not think to divert us from our purpose, by showing us that our drill, our dress, and our weapons, are not entirely perfect and uniform. When the storm shall be past, he shall find us still Americans; no less devoted to the continued Union and prosperity of the country than heretofore.” as Ehime Ora says (https://kpfa.org/episode/hard-knock-radio-april-16-2025/) : ""We become the gods we pray to."" * (https://www.metafilter.com/99840/BuyNLarge-Pledges-to-Promote-Healthier-Foods#3482693) or (https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/114338144470097721) : ""Politics is downstream from culture."" like Frederick Douglass said (https://gephardtdaily.com/local/sanders-ocasio-cortez-draw-20000-in-salt-lake-city-with-blistering-attack-on-trump-era-politics/) : ""Power concedes nothing without a demand.

I don't share his faith, but it's clear he is using it to reach for empathy, compassion, love, mutual understanding. I've known quite few like him, though without the pulpit and seminary education. These are people I can admire, because they read closely into their own religion, and apply those lessons to themselves rather than try to force others. A close friend is a Christian like this, though unchurched. She uses her faith as a guide toward kindness. She'll help anybody any way she can within her limited resources. Even when frustrated, she reaches toward empathy. Way less bigoted than I am, in most respects. And she will only vote in local elections - she leaves federal stuff alone because she is a single mom with three jobs and doesn't feel she understands federal politics well enough to make good decisions.

But the thing is, Israel is a bog standard and boring exemplar of a typical postcolonial disease, when that politics of grievance is both valid in its historicity and then fused with romantic European ethnonationalism.

This, for several weeks before a certain larger university   has suddenly discovered its ****s: Trump Is Selling Jews a Dangerous Lie (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/opinion/trump-jewish-antisemitism-wesleyan.html?unlocked_article_code=1.904.zE9J.5oT_dLblX8Do&smid=em-share) And another thing: cendawanita, great thought-provoking article from Jewish Currents. An element raised not often enough in big/little power relationships is the lack of control that donor countries have once their weapons have left the dock.  Last time I studied this stuff carefully (the 1970s, when Soviet sponsorship of Syria was at one of its peaks), I found a quote from a Soviet ambassador to Syria saying ""Those damned Syrians will take anything but advice"" (name available upon request). It's easy to forget that these big/little arrangements are far from permanent. A good example: Israel's main supplier/supporter until the late 1960's was France. The U.S. only replaced France once Cold War dynamics, plus the withdrawal of France from North Africa, made France's committment wane, and the U.S's committment wax. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, then-President Nixon saw to it that Israel was instantly well-armed after Israel's original setbacks in the early days of the war. For most, this is ancient history. But the dynamics haven't changed since -- only the players. (This is actually a totally separate issue from donor complicity, politics-motivated threats, and pot-stirring insane proposals).

Re: that NYT opinion piece, I don't know if it's related to NYT's now infamous contribution of the Palestine Exception or himself, but: As for Mr. Trump, he declared that Senator Chuck Schumer is “not Jewish anymore,” And then what else, what else did he call him? NYT elided it by simply consigning it to a citation link: Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office alongside Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, Trump attacked the Democrats over their response during his address to Congress on March 6 and targeted Schumer when he was asked about corporate taxes. ‘Schumer is a Palestinian as far as I’m concerned. He’s become a Palestinian. He used to be Jewish. He’s not Jewish anymore. He’s a Palestinian,’ Trump said. I fall into this trap too, but like white woman tears that emerge when feminist issues impacting BIPOC women are being discussed, I have to remind myself, the story here, by 2025, is primarily of Palestinian dispossession and dehumanization.

In addition, the public’s views of Israel have turned more negative over the past three years. More than half of U.S. adults (53%) now express an unfavorable opinion of Israel, up from 42% in March 2022 – before the Hamas attack of Oct. 7, 2023, and the ensuing Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip.

I do want to point out that for every single discussion that has been had on this site about anti-semitism in relation to Palestinians, there has not really been an actual discussion of anti-Palestinian racism (https://antipalestinianracism.org/) - its definitions, and how it manifests, what it entails, etc. This is as much my fault as it is anyone else's, but it was just something I was mulling over. I just watched this Middle East Eye interview with Helena Cobban (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZFgwLrCHlM) , who just authored a book with Rami G. Khouri on ""Understanding Hamas and Why That Matters"" (https://orbooks.com/catalog/understanding-hamas/) , and it's quite illuminating. It's about an hour long; I highly recommend it. The latest abductee in the US is a Palestinian student and activist at Columbia University Mohsen Mahdawi (https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/04/14/palestinian-activist-mohsen-mahdawi-gs-25-detained-by-ice-at-naturalization-appointment/) , who was arrested by ICE when he showed up to take his citizenship test. Anyway the latest from the ceasefire merry-go-round (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/4/15/live-israel-hamas-say-negotiations-underway-as-israel-attacks-gaza-tents) -  Israel is demanding that Hamas disarms, with no commitment towards ending the war, and Hamas is rejecting disarmament as a condition of ceasefire, asserting that resistance is a right they have. (https://xcancel.com/DropSiteNews/status/1911874240590303458#m) Looks like another impasse. I don't know if this is a sign, but several groups of Israeli soldiers have been circulating petitions calling for an end to the war on Gaza (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/4/15/live-israel-hamas-say-negotiations-underway-as-israel-attacks-gaza-tents?update=3644360) .

I can only say that it is truly too bad that Metafilter has become a place where the following happens: 1. Someone early in the thread says “Jews”, (without any caveating, context, or qualifiers) are collectively “participating in a modern day atrocity”. 2. Someone politely comments in reply to that user as though the user had accidentally posted a double link to the front page and not condemned an entire, globally dispersed people to conflation with the acts of a  particular nation state. 3. Other users chime in (again politely!) psychoanalyzing The Jews. “Perhaps this poor tribe is just universally traumatized!” 4. Cendwanita posts an excellent article that really, truly should, if read correctly, make everyone consider if the above conversation/framing about “the special place for American Jews” does anything to help the larger and more important issue of Palestinian dehumanization. I know it is usually a big “no” these days to mentions users by name. But I mention Cendwanita because in my lurking I really do believe they are wrestling with the complexities of this topic in a way that, if emulated by other users, would likely mean that the various MetaTalk threads that crop up around this  ( here (https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26614/An-opportunity-for-healing) and here (https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26606/Antisemitism-on-MetaFilter-and-how-to-reduce-it) etc. ) wouldn’t be needed.  I say this as someone that has gotten actually mad at Cendwanita’s posts but can still see that they put thought and work into them. This is all to say that if folks on this site continue to wonder: “hey, why do threads on this issue seem to always turn into conversations about antisemitism?” Because, before anyone can make thoughtful points about racism directed at Palestinians or post thoughtful articles about “Zionist Realism” someone will post just the most plainly ignorant YouTube comment of a thought generalizing about Jews and Judaism.  It should also be noted that even if one is Jewish it doesn’t preclude one from posting such ignorant nonsense.

Someone early in the thread says “Jews”, (without any caveating, context, or qualifiers) are collectively “participating in a modern day atrocity”. That's one reasonable interpretation of this comment. (https://www.metafilter.com/208414/Genocide-continues-without-interruption#8712278) A more sympathetic reading would interpret it as asking how it is possible for such Jews as are participating in a modern day atrocity to use the phrase ""Never again"" with a straight face. Near as I can tell, the answer to that question is that for those Jews and those Jews only, ""Never again"" means ""Never again to Jews "". The thinking seems to be that the most effective way to overcome irrational hatred is by replacing it with the kind of existential fear best induced via frequent demonstrations of mass killings with total impunity. I don't see it, myself. Apart from being psychologically counterproductive, the current Israeli brand of Zionism looks like internalized victim-blaming - identifying the root cause for countless historical instances of Jews being targeted and killed as the inability of those killed to defend themselves, rather than the antisemitism of their murderers. There's also the matter of treating antisemitism as in some way structurally different from hatred directed at any other minority group. The thinking seems to be that antisemitism has always existed and therefore will always pose the same degree of existential threat. But ""it wouldn't matter what we did, they'd hate us anyway"" is fucking weak sauce as an excuse for doing things that would make anybody hate anybody who did those things exactly because they'd done those things. Israel's ""they hate us because we're Jewish"" is no more justifiable than W's ""they hate us for our freedoms"" and it's really no surprise to me that it's pretty much the same kind of conservatives who seem to be convinced by both",4 favorites,"['https://www.metafilter.com/208414/Genocide-continues-without-interruption#8712278', '/favorited/2/8712820']",2025-04-15 19:23:00,Tuesday

Former Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt supports parts of the Trump administration’s visa crackdown, but said it must be done ‘thoughtfully’ and with due process (https://forward.com/news/712297/students-deported-ice-antisemitism-deborah-lipstadt/) As the Trump administration escalates its campaign to revoke the visas of hundreds of international students — many for their involvement in pro-Palestinian activism — Deborah Lipstadt, the Biden administration’s antisemitism envoy, is offering support for some of the moves. “To depict some of these people as martyrs and heroes is ludicrous,” Lipstadt said in an interview, her words pointed and deliberate. (...) Her remarks place her in a carefully calibrated position — neither in full alignment with critics of the Trump administration’s policy, nor with those who have championed mass deportations as a show of zero tolerance. “I’m not opposed to the administration rescinding the student visas of some of the people that they’re rescinding the student visas of,” she said. “But I just think it should be done properly, according to the laws of the country.” ---- Journalist Ahmed Alnaouq: ‘It’s our duty to make Gaza’s stories immortal’

Weirdly, I see far fewer complaints about being made to feel unsafe arising from criticism of Israel that's directed improperly at Jews rather than properly at Zionists. Perhaps this reflects the fact that criticism explicitly directed at Zionism tends to come from people who manifestly know more about current and historical conditions in Palestine than the typical casually antisemitic yobbo and whose opinions are therefore harder to dismiss. Personally, I generally stick to ""Likud"" or ""Likud and its enablers"" when criticising the current wave of genocide, ""the Israeli and US governments"" when complaining about how nothing useful has made its way through the Security Council these sixty years, and ""the governments of Israel and its allies"" when talking about everything Israel has done from the Nakba to the present",2 favorites,['/favorited/2/8712884'],2025-04-16 01:30:00,Wednesday

There are no deals on the cheap here, to be scribbled on the back of cocktail napkins. President Trump and his team will need to put in the time and effort and press key Arab states and the Palestinians to do their part and, in an even tougher task, push Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to make concessions. Mr. Netanyahu’s recent visit to Washington suggests that Mr. Trump isn’t yet ready to try. The Israeli leader and his far-right coalition are disinclined to strike deals, especially given that the Trump administration has imposed few constraints on Israel’s actions in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon or Syria. Mr. Netanyahu is facing trial on various charges for which he can escape judgment only by remaining in office. He is not going to jeopardize his hold on power. That means in Israel there’s little significant domestic pressure to change course. Israel’s renewed offensive in Gaza failed to galvanize the political left even though most Israelis say they want the cease-fire to continue.

In colonial India, in the Jim Crow South, and in Palestine, the goal of nonviolent resistance was to leverage one’s sacrifices, to use one’s courage when faced with the repressive violence of the state as a tool for moral awakening, to move people of conscience to act. To that end, it had worked. Over the past decade, sympathy for Palestinians in the United States has grown steadily, particularly among the young, while support for Israel has plummeted. But last year’s campus demonstrations were almost everywhere repressed by the police, and the fact that a majority of Americans supported putting conditions on military aid to Israel found no reflection in either party’s platform. Manal, Bilal, and others in Nabi Saleh had done everything they were supposed to do. The moral awakening occurred as planned. It just didn’t make a difference.

This is what we see: the last 18 months of heartbreaking war have shown us that the most successful way of bringing the hostages home and creating a lasting peace is through diplomacy. By the end of the first phase of the second ceasefire and hostage release deal, 135 hostages had been released through negotiation, just eight by military action, with at least three tragically killed by the Israel Defense Forces. (...) Such incidents are too painful and shocking to take in, but we know in our hearts we cannot turn a blind eye or remain silent at this renewed loss of life and livelihoods, with hopes dwindling for a peaceful reconciliation and the return of the hostages. This most extremist of Israeli governments is openly encouraging violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, strangling the Palestinian economy and building more new settlements than ever. This extremism also targets Israeli democracy, with the independence of the judicial system again under fierce attack, the police increasingly resembling a militia and repressive laws are being advanced as provocative partisan populism is bitterly dividing Israeli society. Israel’s soul is being ripped out and we, members of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, fear for the future of the Israel we love and have such close ties to. Silence is seen as support for policies and actions that run contrary to our Jewish values. Led by the families of the hostages, hundreds of thousands of Israelis are demonstrating on the streets against the return to war by an Israeli government that has not prioritised the return of the hostages. We stand with them. We stand against the war. We acknowledge and mourn the loss of Palestinian life. We yearn for the “day after” this conflict when reconciliation can start. As we mark the festival of freedom with so many hostages still in captivity, it is our duty, as Jews, to speak out.

The reason are the high rate of uninvolved Palestinian casualties in the bombings, and the failure to investigate the causes. The feeling is that the attacks are more aggressive, and that the consideration of the deaths of civilians has decreased - and that the operational results are not improving as a result. (https://xcancel.com/academic_la/status/1915858386555703738?s=19) When pilots complete an attack, after they have been given certain estimates of collateral damage, about the possibility of uninvolved civilians dying with the military target. And then they open their phones and discover completely different numbers. Much higher. Last Saturday, for example, the Palestinians reported 52 deaths in Gaza (until seven in the evening). When they want to check why, and the Air Force tries to investigate afterwards - and this is a body that investigates at the most reliable level in the IDF - it does not receive adequate cooperation The tension is so high that, as of this week, Air Force Commander Bar personally approves every strike that the Air Force carries out in the Strip. But the tension is unresolved. There is no way around it, the IDF is not taking adequate steps to protect Palestinian civilian lives.

In interviews with Israeli investigative TV program, nine senior officials from previous US administration vent their frustrations in dealing with Netanyahu during Gaza war (https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-biden-aide-israel-missed-opportunity-for-saudi-deal-hopefully-it-wont-do-so-again/) Oh sure, now you're talking. You have all these regular (and establishment) Americans carrying water for you, losing their tempers at each other, providing cover for genocide, equivocating war crimes with bread-and-butter disagreements, but now you're talking. Despite his animosity toward Netanyahu, Biden stood by Israel through the end of his term. “This was the most significant political peril of Joe Biden’s political career. The easiest thing for Joe Biden… to do if he was worried about the votes in Michigan, is to basically get a little soft. He refused to do it,” Nides said. “There was an enormous pressure on [Biden] inside the White House to change his position. So, when I hear comments about [how] he wasn’t good enough, or he didn’t have Israel’s back, am I disgusted by it? 100%. Is it true? 100% no.” (...) ""Can you imagine the [backlash] if it was Amos meeting with Hamas and negotiating with Hamas. Do you understand the level of anger that would come out of this?” said the former US ambassador, referring to the unprecedented direct talks that Trump’s hostage envoy Adam Boehler held with Hamas officials last month. Israel fumed over the negotiations but has avoided criticizing them publicly. Herzog, too, made a point of summarizing Biden’s perilous term positively. “God did the State of Israel a favor that Biden was the president during this period, because it could have been much worse. We fought [in Gaza] for over a year and the administration never came to us and said, ‘ceasefire now.’ It never did. And that’s not to be taken for granted,” the former Israeli ambassador said. “Hamakor” anchor Raviv Drucker mused on whether that was the Biden administration’s flaw — that it was too loyal and pro-Israel to ever fully pressure Netanyahu. The Israeli premier, he posited, understood this and chose to drag his feet on making key decisions throughout the war, to buy time until Trump returned to office. Maybe that's Israeli English for ""working tirelessly towards a ceasefire"". ----- New bill seeks to extend U.S. military benefits to Americans serving in the Israeli army -

The documentarian manages to stay calm and polite as guns are repeatedly pointed at him in the West Bank. Then someone shoves him … (https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/27/the-settlers-review-this-vital-film-forces-louis-theroux-to-do-something-hes-never-done-before) The Settlers lays all those worries to rest in an instant. By travelling to Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Theroux is revisiting the subject matter of a documentary he made in 2011. That film, The Ultra Zionists, concerned a clutch of Jewish people who – propelled by religious nationalism – were infringing on international law by building their homes in Palestinian territory. But, 14 years on, he has returned to find that the settlements have accelerated. The settler ideology has found itself gaining political traction. What was fringe has now become mainstream. As such, The Settlers requires Theroux to alter his approach. Ever since Weird Weekends, his stock in trade has been the faux-naïf, lulling his subjects into a false sense of security with his bumbling charm. With everyone from Jimmy Savile to the members of the Westboro Baptist Church, he was able to lay traps they simply didn’t see coming. But the situation in the West Bank is so dire that the kid gloves have to come off. This is partly because he and his crew repeatedly find themselves subject to many of the confrontations and intimidations that blight the lives of Palestinians on a daily basis. During a visit to a Palestinian home, settlers drive up and point guns with laser sights through the windows at him. More than once, he has to politely ask people to lower their guns while talking to him. In one especially tense encounter, he has to bark “Don’t touch me” at a pair of balaclava-wearing Israeli soldiers. In the early years, Theroux would gently attempt to convince his subjects that their worldview might not be the only one around. In the later, more serious films, he would leave long silences on which the viewer could project scorn on his behalf, saving his true feelings for the voiceover afterwards. In truth, there is some of this in The Settlers. When he meets Ari Abramowitz, a Texas settler in the West Bank who refuses to even use the word “Palestinian”, he holds his tongue. When he meets a rabbi who calls Palestinians “savages” and “camel riders”, he manages to do the same. Then comes Daniella Weiss. A key member of the Israeli settler movement for 50 years, Weiss is Theroux’s prime target. She is able to hide her extreme views behind a friendly smile, no matter how aggressively he plays cat and mouse with her. But, at the end of the episode, they both get to each other like never before. Theroux corners Weiss and presses her on settler violence against Palestinians. She says none exists. He says he has witnessed it, notably in a video of a Palestinian being shot. She claims the Israeli shooter was acting in retaliation, then physically shoves Theroux in the hope that he’ll push her back. Instead, he does something he’s never done before. He calls her a sociopath",5 favorites,"['https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-biden-aide-israel-missed-opportunity-for-saudi-deal-hopefully-it-wont-do-so-again/', 'https://mondoweiss.net/2024/05/new-bill-seeks-to-extend-u-s-military-benefits-to-americans-serving-in-the-idf/', 'https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2025-04-28/ty-article-opinion/.premium/invoking-never-again-as-more-children-die/00000196-7bb2-d41c-a7ff-fff765000000', 'https://archive.is/RC3xo', 'https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/27/the-settlers-review-this-vital-film-forces-louis-theroux-to-do-something-hes-never-done-before', '/favorited/2/8717272']",2025-04-28 18:21:00,Monday

Transcript: Theroux (voiceover): In the north of the West Bank, I was heading back to the settlement of Evyatar, where I'd been hosted by Malkiel, the horse-wrangler. Since my visit, I'd learned a little more about the settlement's relations with its neighbouring Palestinian town of Beita. How Beita had been subject to settler attacks and how it, in turn, had organised regular protests of the settlement. Demonstrators had been killed and others wounded during the clashes. One of the deaths of a Turkish-American volunteer, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, made headlines. Now the settlement was holding a festival to celebrate its recent recognition by the Israeli State. Entertainments had been laid on and families from settlements from around the West Bank had converged for a day of music and activities. One of those speaking was Daniella. Announcer (translation): Please applaud one of the mothers of the settlement movement. Weiss (translation): Since October 7th until now. I have never stopped, not for a single moment, promoting more and more Evyatars, more and more settlements. Happy holiday! (cheering and applause) Theroux (approaches Weiss): How are you? Weiss: You want to go there? Theroux: Yeah, it's a bit quieter. Theroux (voiceover): As the festivities wound down, I had a moment to speak to Daniella on a hilltop overlooking the Palestinian town of Beita. Theroux: So you've been talking about settling, you've talked about displacing, wanting the Palestinians to go, you said, to Africa, to Canada, to England, you don't care where. Weiss: Turkey. Theroux: Mm-hm. What would be wrong with either a two-state solution or a one-state solution where everyone had the same rights? Weiss: We want to have a Jewish state based on Jewish rules, on Jewish values. It's not a relationship of neighbours. Theroux: Why not? Weiss: Because we are two different nations. Different. Theroux: I just wonder whether you feel, or you're aware that, um... you know, they're really suffering. And there's been settlers rampaging through the area of the West Bank, so there's all this... Weiss: Agitation. Theroux: ...death. Tragedy. Right? Weiss: Tragedy. Theroux: When a people is invaded, right? And then put under a military occupation, deprived of their rights, that anger seems to be an understandable response, an appropriate response. Weiss: There is no such thing as settler violence. Did I speak... I don't know if... I don't mind saying it again. Theroux: Mm-hm. Weiss: And I don't mind... I will be glad to explain. Theroux: You don't believe it's real? There are videos. You can see them. Weiss: You see what? OK. Let's say... Theroux: Mm-hm. Weiss: ...we have a camera here. Theroux: Yes. Weiss: And I do this. (steps toward Theroux, delivers a solid two-handed shove to the chest) Theroux: (steps backward to regain balance, grins) Yeah. Weiss: Do something. You don't mind what I did to you? You don't... Theroux: Well, I won't do that to you. Weiss: You won't do that. Theroux: No. Weiss: And then the camera takes just part. Theroux: Mm-hm. Weiss: You don't have the full picture. Then I say you're violent! You're violent against a woman. This is exactly what is going on all the time with what you call, er... Theroux: Settler violence. Weiss: Settler violence. Settlers do not wake up in the morning, or do not go and wait for sundown to attack. No, no, no, no. (heatedly) Why should we wake up in the morning and think about violence? Why? Our life is good! Theroux: Because you want the Palestinians to leave. Weiss: No! No, no, no! Theroux: You've said so. Weiss: I said that what is on my mind all the time... is how to bring more people to settle the land. (points) This is a new development by Jews. This is Yitzhar, this we can... Here we can develop. Here we cannot develop. I never think in terms of... I know this is Beita. Theroux: Mm-hm. Weiss: I don't think in... I don't think about Beita. Theroux: Why not? Weiss: Because I think about... I am a Jew. Theroux: They're people. Weiss: I'm a settler. Theroux: They're people. Weiss: I'm a human being. Theroux: Yes you are. And so are they. Weiss: So I do not think about this. Theroux: You're thinking about tribalism. Thinking of your own people to the exclusion... It would be understandable to think of your own people or your own children first. But to think about other people, other children not at all? That seems sociopathic. Weiss: (chuckles) I can, uh... Theroux: Doesn't it? Weiss: No, not at all. This is normal. To my children, I give everything, because I... The normal thing, normal thing for me, is to pray for my own people. That's it. So now I continue.

https://www.metafilter.com/208414/Genocide-continues-without-interruption,toastyk,https://www.metafilter.com/user/295700,"DropSiteNews has an on-the-record interview with senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan (https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/osama-hamdan-hamas-interview-podcast-gaza-israel) - it is pretty long, but here are some tidbits: Osama Hamdan: Well, we have said that we are ready for any option which can give the Palestinian people the chance to start the reconstruction of Gaza. We have talked to Abu Mazen [the nickname of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas] about forming a national unity government. We have talked about a technocratic government. And then there was a suggestion from the Egyptian side to have a committee of leaders, independent leaders, from Gaza, to take control in Gaza for a while and then we can go to general elections. We've said yes, because if they were nationalist and they are working for Gaza’s benefit and the people’s, why not have them? It's OK. We've said clearly, we are a people under occupation. We are not fighting just because we like to fight or it's a good idea to fight others. We are not fighting the Israelis because, for example, they are Jewish people. We don't have a problem with the Jewish people. In fact, when they were deported from Europe, they came to our lands and they have lived among the Arabs and the Muslims as respected humans with their religion as Jewish people. The problem is that they are occupying the land now. They turned from being people with a specific religion, which is respected by the Muslims, they turned to be occupiers and they are using their religion to legitimize that occupation, which is not accepted. Even if a Muslim came to occupy my land, I will fight him. It is not related to the religion. It is related to being an occupier or not an occupier. I believe one of the reasons why the Israelis have assassinated some of the Palestinian leaders was because they have the chance to talk directly to the United States. They want to prevent any kind of contact between the Palestinian resistance and the United States administration because they have a narrative that those are terrorists. But when they talk to the administration, the administration discovered that they are freedom fighters and they have a political narrative and they have a political stand, and they are seeking to have a political solution. This is what the Israelis are trying to prevent, and this is what, I believe, the United States administration and the congressmen, they have to understand and they have to go to work according to that.

The deal is said to include provisions for ending the war, rebuilding Gaza, and redefining control of the Strip—potentially over Israel’s objections. ➤ Comprehensive Framework: According to Arab and U.S. diplomatic sources cited by Israel Hayom, the Trump administration is preparing to announce a full plan to end the war in Gaza. The deal would include long-term reconstruction and governance arrangements, with the U.S. playing a central role. ➤ Phased Implementation: The initial phase would involve the U.S. helping manage aid distribution via the Israeli-built supply centers. Later stages would include U.S. and Arab oversight of Gaza’s reconstruction. The plan envisions an eventual Israeli military withdrawal—alongside a partial disarmament process by Hamas fighters. ➤ Resistance From Hamas: One obstacle, the article cites is still Hamas’s military wing, which refuses to disarm or leave Gaza. Egypt and the Palestinian Authority are pressuring Hamas to agree, amid fears that Israel may launch a new major assault after Trump’s Gulf visit. Senior Hamas leaders were reportedly summoned urgently to Cairo to finalize terms before Trump’s expected announcement. Hamas or its leaders have not issued a statement indicating as such. ➤ Key Concessions Under Consideration: The deal may allow Hamas leadership to remain involved in Gaza’s future civil governance and possibly grant immunity from assassination. Another option reportedly being weighed is incorporating Hamas’s internal security forces into a broader Palestinian policing framework. ➤ Israel May Be Sidelined: Israel Hayom reports that Israel is not fully involved in shaping the plan—and may be presented with the deal as a fait accompli. The report suggests Prime Minister Netanyahu will be forced to either accept the terms or face a severe coalition crisis. ➤ MK Amit Halevi, a Netanyahu ally, harshly criticized Trump on Telegram, accusing him of excluding Israel from recent deals, including the U.S. ceasefire with Yemen’s Ansar Allah movement. Halevi warned that Israel is being cast as a sacrificial lamb in Trump’s broader regional strategy. ➤ Strategic Concerns: Israeli officials are increasingly alarmed that the U.S. is shifting toward unilateral diplomacy—pursuing agreements with Iran, Turkey, Syria, and Hamas without fully incorporating Israeli interests. One unnamed Israeli official cited by the paper worried aloud, “In the coming reconciliation with all the players ahead of Trump’s visit, we may find ourselves in the role of the lamb—and the smell of the grill is already in the air.” ➤ American officials cited in the article attempted to downplay the tensions, saying that while disagreements exist, the overall relationship remains strong. “We always check whether Israel might be harmed,” one official said. However, the U.S. also emphasized it has its own strategic interests beyond Israel’s concerns. ➤ Netanyahu’s Office Silent: The Prime Minister’s Office declined to comment formally on the report. Israeli officials are reportedly maintaining quiet contact with pro-Israel figures in the U.S. administration.

His administration’s efforts to go after tech monopolies were about a decade too late, but were probably our last, best chance to reign in tech billionaires.

That's not arguing about the past. That's asking ourselves a question about the present: if these are the people in the opposition, either craven or corrupt or both, either unprincipled and ineffective, or aloof and indifferent, then how can we expect them to meet the moment, and make the hard decisions that will be necessary (if they ever get power again) to ensure the wrongs of the current administration are righted and that we cannot fall victim to our current predicament again. Assume third parties are out, that our 2 party system is too entrenched. Then, take it for granted that the republicans are incorrigible. They are openly corrupt, that's their whole deal.

The crowd yesterday skewed young (amazing since the musical guests were jurassic.) which I found interesting as the LA protests seem to me to skew much older. These folks were excited.

This is not re-litigation. it is not a circular firing squad. I cannot control how people will choose to respond to this, just know that I don't take your responses personally. We are all hurt, and scared, and that's ok. In no particular order: The Gerontocracy I think we have general agreement that this is bad. It's bad for a number of reasons, some of which I am qualified to address as a fellow old person. - Old people have less energy, mental and physical. - The rate at which the technological curve is accelerating means we need young people that are closer to the leading edge of the social change being driven by these changes. I'm a boomer, and when I was born, there were no personal computers. No cell phones, no social media. No 12 hour a day screen time. There were 3 TV channels, everyone shared the same news and culture sources. - Strategically, having an old roster means losing critical voting power more frequently than with a young roster. - Old civil servants have been living in the DC bubble for a very long time. The reason AOC energizes is people outside the beltway can relate, and she can relate to them, because she was them not long ago. - Playing the same game for 50 years limits your view of possible ways to play the game. - Note that I am not suggesting old people stop serving. They have critical institutional knowledge, they can have a deeper historical perspective, they have strong networks that can be leveraged to great benefit. Serve, but not in leadership roles. Be the sage voice to balance the energy and enthusiasm of the young leadership. Money and Corporate Capture This is a huge one. While there is a bright line between the cultural approaches to governance between the two parties, both parties are very happy to eat from the trough of corporate money. - Citizen's United has got to go. Money buying elections is bad. Money buying Courts is bad. Money buying elected officials is bad. - Having lobbyist do your homework has got to go. There is a place for this; the human world is an insanely complicated machine and one person can't grasp it all. I think we need a system for gathering input from all the various parts of the machine so that our leaders and representatives can have good information for decision making.  But what we have now is part of corporate capture, and the republicans have metastasized id with ALEC. This is a ripe are of discussion for how we can do better. - Related: we need a better path for our representatives than the revolving door back into industries they've regulated. Again, corporate capture. The DNC has not put forward candidates that are interested in solving these problem. - This is the big one for me. Most of the democrats in my lifetime have been caretakers of Decline. The calming voice of the pilot as the plane descends into an unplanned water landing.  We have had some success; Obamacare, which stopped the bleeding a but, but was not the obvious solution (single-payer healthcare) that we know is right. This is what happens when money blinds you to the right course of action. They are serving corporate interests instead of our own. It's easy to justify: going up against corporate interest in hard, I'd lose my seat, and therefore my power, so I'll work inside the system to do what what I can. This is the conservator ship of decline. This is related to my final point for this morning, Lack of Moral Courage This certainly isn't just a Democrats problem, but we are  rife with leaders that lack the moral courage to stand up to - Corporate Capture - The dismantling of democratic guide rails (the GOP ratfuckery of the past 40 years) - Creeping theocracy - Genocide Taking the moral stance only when it is convenient is not taking the moral stance at all. Some of this I blame on the audience testing of the political consultancy class: 'crafting message' to target specific demographics, instead of speaking with the clear, moral voice of your convictions. Some of it is electing people without clear moral convictions (I.e., being vulnerable as constituents to being calmed by the 'crafted messages') And the constituency. You and me (not you, the fellow standing next to you). I've been to more protests in the past month than in the previous 9 years (and that number was not zero). Good on me for getting out at all, but this is the level of grotesquerie that was needed to prod me personally to stepping up to the task of trying to turn the ship. Purity Testing The perfect is the enemy of the good. To right the ship, we need to build the biggest possible tent we can. It's all hands on deck. The deck of the tent. See? Enemy, perfect, good. Someone voted for Trump twice, but is having second thoughts? Come on in, let's get you a nice cup of tea. No, I don't agree with you on some of your issues, we can discuss that later, and I mean, really have a discussion. Sometimes the issues we talk about aren't actually the issues we actually care about. Let's tease that apart after we put out all these fires. I can always do more, and I'm not going to beat myself up for these past failures, but I am going to try to learn from them, and ask myself each day what I'm willing to do to help save the country. If I'm not willing to email my leaders everyday, if I'm not willing to park the car and tear down a hate sign when I see one pop up in my neighborhood, if I'm not willing to give up my Saturdays to go to a protest or a rally, what am I willing to do? What can I do? Maybe today all I can do is try to post a constructive letter to my friends at MeFi. I hope there's something in here that sparks constructive discussion, or personal reflection. I hope everyone decides to give just a little more. These are dark times, and we are the only ones that can advocate for better.

Ok so the republicans are evil and the dems are more interested in fundraising than stopping the evil. So let’s make the dems better. Maybe we can start by pointing out what’s wrong with dems, change the personnel responsible for the dems sucking, get rid of the old turds for some younger voices. Actually no, we can’t do that, because when you start saying XYZ is what is wrong with the dems, they need to change, if they change they will win, and if they change and win they will stop the republicans.

I will continue to vote for Democrats when that makes sense, but they clearly don't value the things I value as a party. Our first-past-the-post system  is great for the status quo and the powerful, which is why it will never change. Parties that don't have a reason to exist get replaced. It looks like Democrats have no interest in running a real change candidate, because real change scares the people at the top (and voters can't decide what kind of change they want to solidify a majority). A third party could arise and replace the Democrats if it could resonate with a broad enough portion of the electorate. But as we've seen, gluing together strong leftists, corporate moderates who just want reasonableness back, and disaffected or checked-out nonvoters together is a HARD task. Obama had a collapsing economy and a failed war to help him. A third party could also arise and act as a spoiler (like Perot did in 1992). Reactionaries are on the rise, but if they wreck the economy in the next 2 to 4 years, it's hard to predict what will happen. We know they won't leave quietly, and we know they'll keep trying and that Democrats are not up to the task of rebuilding the laws and norms that could prevent that. There's only so much we can do as individuals unless we are prepared to start the violent revolution phase.

Chuck Schumer is in the Senate because New York state voters have chosen him, repeatedly, for that job. Trump is president again because a majority of U.S. voters elected him. In every single one of these circumstances, voters have had a choice: The old person or someone else.  They chose the old person. So you think old people shouldn't be allowed to hold elected office?  OK, kinda sounds like ageism to me, but it's certainly an opinion that you are not alone in holding. But the alleged ""gerontocracy"" is just... voters choosing old people rather than the available alternatives. You can spin narratives about the DNC, corporate donors, and all kinds of other bogeymen.

Please go on ahead and critique the gerontocracy: I agree! That whole Silent/Boomer leadership group should be forcibly retired: they don't understand technology, they're unable to communicate with anyone under fifty, they're absolutely beholden to a network of corporate donors that prevents them from embracing better economic policies, so they differentiate themselves only on social policies that mostly turn off working-class voters. Almost nobody is ""economically conservative but socially liberal"": it's a losing game, but the establishment cannot fathom abandoning giant legacy media buys. In re Biden, it's a fucking travesty and deserves critique. He should have announced in late 2023 that he wasn't running. I'm still appalled. He did a great job as President, especially given his negative majorities in Congress, but there needed to be a real primary. It absolutely deserves a postmortem. But here's the trouble: if we plot the electorate on a left/right distribution (and yes this is reductive), it's not a bell curve. The left half of the distribution starts out from the center looking like a bell curve, but then there's this smaller but still statistically significant bump all the way near the left edge—a bump that is wildly overrepresented on this website. This distribution makes it real hard to find a candidate that doesn't alienate a big chunk of potential voters. Nominate someone who can appeal to socially not-very-liberal mainstream voters, and the Progressive Bump gets steamed because that candidate isn't progressive enough—and to be fair, that candidate likely will be too far to the right of center economically even for the rest of the electorate, all for the donor-related reasons mentioned above. But nominate someone who can pass every progressive shibboleth, and the entire rest of the electorate is going to be like ha ha are you fucking kidding? Saint Bernie would have won six states, tops, in 2016, once the electorate heard all the truly stupid shit he had 40 years to say in addition to the on-point critique of the system he was making. Harris never said anything definitive about fucking Gaza because she knew that only like 10% of Americans actually care enough to make it an issue, and half of them are on the other side. My excessively long-winded point here is that it's absolutely necessary to critique the current Dem Party, but to think that there's this groundswell that will rise up and create the conditions for someone who passes all the progressive tests to win in 2028 is super dubious.

(...) While enabling Israel’s 16-month-long intensified blockade and bombardment of Gaza, the Biden administration appeared incapable of comprehending the scale of its own hypocrisy, especially when compared to its stance on Ukraine, another territory subject to illegal invasion and occupation. Within the State Department, concern grew. Even career members of the foreign and civil services, accustomed to the willingness of previous administrations to rely on the creativity of government attorneys to provide a passable legal veneer, found the flagrant disregard difficult to reconcile with oaths taken to uphold the Constitution. Many expressed concerns about the damage to America’s global standing, the increased likelihood of terrorism in the Middle East, and the risk of becoming bogged down in a broader war. Inside the office dedicated to advocating for human rights in the Middle East, it became increasingly difficult to carry out the department’s mission. (...) The history of America’s unwillingness to sacrifice the profits of the U.S. defense industry to the rule of law, combined with the unique privilege enjoyed by the state of Israel, should have meant that U.S. support for Israel in the aftermath of October 7, 2023, was not surprising. Yet even the Israeli military expected the United States to allow them to carry out the indiscriminate bombing campaign only for a matter of weeks before reining in the scale of destruction, as the U.S. had repeatedly done in the past. Instead, the Biden administration violated American laws and bypassed Congress to rush an unprecedented $17.9 billion in weapons and security assistance to Israel, all while lying to the American public about working tirelessly toward a ceasefire. And if the dozens of backchannel and internal opposition wasn't enough, there's also actual public polling.

But I also don't think anyone has succeeded in demonstrating that refusing to vote for the Democrat in general elections will change the party or advance the goals or progressives and leftists. What I keep coming back to is this: whether liberal or leftist, it seems like what most people want in these conversations is an apology followed by a conversion, which is hypothetically the beginnings of a movement but in the moment boils down mostly to the wonderful feeling of being acknowledged as morally and pragmatically correct. It's what liberals demand from leftists in these conversations, and what leftists ultimately demand of liberals. That kind of performative dominance bullshit is always going to benefit the the right wing because it's fundamentally a right-wing desire . Among liberals and leftists, scolding is not an effective political practice because it's not even vaguely empathetic. It is a status-seeking behavior, a hierarchy-making or -reinforcing behavior. Ask yourself: how do you react to someone saying ""I told you so"" or ""this is all your fault for not doing what I said?"" The harder thing is to consider why, if we're so goddamn right about everything, we aren't actually achieving those positive outcomes. What do *we* need to do differently? Because we can't make those other people do something different. We don't actually have control over them. We' not just going to rise to dominance over them, and we should't want something as reductive and dehumanizing as that anyway. If your ""we"" is ""vote Blue for pragmatic reasons,"" then consider: what's not working when you try to explain this as a tactical decision? What appeals aren't working, what about this strategy needs to be modified or changed? Pragmatic progressive voters need to ask themselves, ""What have we been fucking up at?"" If your ""we"" is ""the Democratic Party needs to change, and we can't just 'vote Blue no matter who,'"" then what parts of the strategy so far have failed to yield change? What are third parties, outsider candidates, and protestors doing that isn't working or isn't overcoming the obstacles we perceive? Leftists, too, need to ask themselves, ""What have we been fucking up at?"" If all you do is blame intransigent, idealistic lefties; or corrupt, venal, senile Democrats; or money; or whiteness; or whatever, then all you are doing is fixating on something that is outside you, and something you don't get to choose for or force to change unless you already hold a lot of levers of power. All you can change is your own rhetoric, your own tactics, your own choices. This is the lesson I take from the confirmation of what so many people believed and so many others feared about Biden's cognitive abilities and the decisions made in his circle: It's a lesson in the dangers of thinking you're so goddamned right that nothing besides your own rightness can ever be admitted to the conversation. Biden and his people seem to have fundamentally believed that he was the only one who could beat Trump. So did his people. They rejected anything that didn't fit with that. It was ageist. It was right-wing bullshit. It was naive lefties who weren't part of the coalition in 2020 anyway and would alienate moderates. And then this out-of-touch, self-deluding, smug institutionalist bullshit ran smack into reality on the one hand, with that disastrous debate, and the power of the right-wing mediasphere, on the other, with its ability to set the narrative as one of Biden's ineptitude and decrepitude, the better to shift the conversation away from their own mouth-foaming, country-tanking, planet-destroying, corrupt, psychopathic standard-bearer. The Bidenites' belief that it was till somehow always 1994, and that 1994 was the great redemption for 1972, crashed into the fact that it was in fact the year 2024. The unexamined ideological prior that Israel must always be supported ran into a generational shift in awareness about Palestine and Benjamin Netanyahu, and made the Biden team culpable for ethnic cleansing to the left while also giving them no way to accede to that reality without losing ground elsewhere. And even then, it was just too damned risky and scary to leave their  comfort zone, because what about the big money donors and the right wing running against us on the Middle East and the economy at the same time? So they ran what felt safe and comfortable, and it fucking failed, morally, practically, politically, whatever-ly. and now they think they can bide their time, wait for the ""inevitable"" backlash against Trumpism, and get back to the status ante quo where things slipped rightward more slowly and ignorably, and where their conventional wisdom was treated with the empty gestures of respect that seem so pleasantly anaesthetizing. But it's also the lesson I take from the ongoing political failures of the left, a failure that's arguably been happening for close to sixty years at this point. It's been decades of splintering groups and structures, of adding new demands even as old victories get rolled back, of disgusted withdrawal, of insisting that other institutions Become Leftist or the leftists will take their ball and go home. And then for the most part the institutions decided to follow the safe money and the party kept running towards the mythical center and away from the lefties. They can afford to lose elections; leftists couldn't and can't. Making them lose elections doesn't cost them enough to  give up what they think they'd have to to bring the left fully onside. And now some of the last places where some kind of leftist or at least pseudoleftist messaging and institutionalism was hanging on -- the universities, the blue cities, the social services, the nonprofits -- are under attack from something a hell of a lot scarier and deadlier than the cowardly, complacent, cadaverous shitlibs, and some of 'em are folding fast. So what now? Democratic leadership isn't getting any leftier, Bernie's not getting any younger, and third parties aren't getting any less hopeless or grift-y. Holding big protests doesn't get much news coverage no matter how many people show up and no matter how many New York Times and Washington Post subscriptions get cancelled. But at least the left can keep telling everyone how goddamned right the left is and was about everything, which means it's really everyone else's problem for failing to acknowledge this. So everyone is fucking up. Liberals are losing politically. The left is also losing politically. Shouldn't folks who are losing spend their time thinking about what they can change up, instead of just complaining that they've been wronged? And if the field is rigged against you, then there's little to be won by complaining to the folks doing the rigging. Who are you complaining to, exactly?",17 favorites,['/favorited/2/8712006'],2025-04-14 05:53:00,Monday

But just as Trump was such a bizarre example of American politics, so was Biden. With every month, he bled the kind of support that would have built networks in a crucial election year because socially progressive activist spaces would not have tolerated such an egregious example of America-supported war. But the party would rather break it, both formal and informally. MANY of those against genocide still voted for Harris anyway, but until you want to have a reckoning how much coalition-building energy was sapped by this (which may explain the almost-deranged energy amongst the agenda setters that was like a sigh of relief when Harris is the presumptive nominee but that was not enough time to turn the ship around especially with Biden insisting on no daylight between them), then we'll keep circling around the issue. The ones with energy and motivation to go out need direction. So you want to all come together. The problem is the same that the Ukrainian civil society had to face when Russia came: do you want to work with the Azov battalion or not?

Hillary Clinton was a bad candidate, but so was Bernie Sanders (not a Democrat, but it doesn't really matter in this context). Biden was a bad candidate in 2020, but there was no-one else who stood out. All three of them were/are too old and too much part of the problem. What I found a bit troubling in TFA is that it takes for granted that Kamala Harris was a bad candidate and Tim Walz a bad VP candidate, when the reality is that they did really well, given the circumstances. I heard on some podcast that they did very well as long as they stood on a clear populist economic platform, and only lost it when they began focusing on Trump as a threat to democracy. Trump is a threat to democracy, but the average voter wasn't tuned into that in November. They were worrying about their bills. I think it is interesting that Harris wouldn't have won a primary. I don't know who would, but to me it is part of what is wrong with the party. She is charismatic, smart, real and representative of where the US is heading. And yet all the pundits are certain that a better candidate would have been male and white. The racist vote is already covered 100% by the Republicans.

Additionally, Tim Walz has been on a nationwide mea culpa (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tim-walz-election-mistakes-trump-b2731079.html) - these are his takeaways - failure to outreach to Latinos, failure to understand anger over Gaza, and failure to assess the new media landscape: On their inability to match Joe Biden’s outreach to America’s Latino citizens four years earlier, Walz reflected: “I think especially with the Latino community and an immigrant community, these are driven people to succeed, and that is the American Dream. “And I think sometimes we’re a little bit, we’re a little bit too much, you know, you should be ashamed for being successful.” On public opposition to Israel’s military response to the events of October 7, 2023, which led to heckling at Harris’s rallies over the Biden administration’s perceived inaction to prevent the bloodshed, Walz said: “It needs to be spoken that there’s the angst over Gaza and things that needed to be addressed. “I think we have to understand: How do we articulate that we’re better for that? It’s obviously self-evident now that for folks in Gaza, Donald Trump’s not going to be the [one] to help them. We got to make sure that they believe that we would have been.” On their campaign’s failure to engage with new media, Walz acknowledged that Trump had been astute in taking advice from his teenage son Barron Trump about appearing on Joe Rogan and Theo Von’s influential podcasts, which helped him to secure the support of their young male listenerships. Walz regretted that he and Harris had not been “looser” in their approach and revealed that he had discussed how best to reach young men via the media and platforms they enjoy with his own son Gus Walz, who suggested there is a perception among his peers that right-wing politics is more fun.

The reasons to rally behind Harris once Biden did drop out were even better.

No, the US' outsized influence has way more to do with being the Amazon of countries, as bad an analogy as that is. We have been allowed and even encouraged to take a little cut of everything happening in the world in exchange for the provision of benefits concrete and abstract. Most countries even felt like they were getting decent enough value for money. We have been subsidized by the rest of the world for so long that we have forgotten that it's even happening. The shit most of us buy ain't stupid cheap here compared to the rest of the world because we're lucky or have a big economy or whatever other story people like to tell about themselves. It's because other countries actively work to make sure we can buy the cheap shit by propping up the value of the dollar. This is good for them because big stable markets are good for their own economies, a strong dollar makes it easier for us to buy their shit, and investing in Treasuries is (or was, anyway) seen as a safe bet for not losing money. They get economic development, we get cheap shit and the opportunity to focus on the top of the value chain in our own exports. Plus we implicitly promised to defend the trade routes that keep the whole thing humming along lifting entire nations out of poverty. But now a group of know nothings have made it very clear that we have not only forgotten the deal but are actively mad about it, even though the deal isn't the problem, the problem is our own cock slobbering over billionaires preventing us from ensuring that the people here who are impacted by the negative consequences of the arrangement were looked after, leading them to anger, which of course has been directed outward rather than at the people truly responsible.

The economy sucks? there's a border crisis? the US is 'getting a raw deal' compared to other countries? The economic outcome of pushing everyone into college instead of manufacturing has had terrible outcomes? Well, if you actually believe the Sanders/Warren wing of the party - 60% of American households live paycheck to paycheck - there is a two income trap, college debt is out of control, etc - then who cares if Trump tears it all down? It''s apparently not making Americans better off, etc. You just said 60% live paycheck to paycheck!  Tearing it down is getting back at the billionaire class, in a dumb, roundabout way. And the Biden wing can't say anything - can't refute that (even though it's total nonsense) because it would lead to a split in the Democratic party and tacit disagreement that 'something has to change. ' We are seeing the dichotomy in action currently - the previous economy wasn't that bad -that tinkering around the edges and directing help at those who need it without tearing everything down was the smart move - but Democrats have neither the messaging skill nor the party unity to say everything is ok and convince anyone it was true. And then the legal arm was just worthless, enabling Trump's violence with endless evidence gathering, turning justice delayed into justice denied. And that's still leadership's play - to sit back and gather evidence and review plans with consultants instead of doing - anything.

Remember that one debate where he just zoned out at the mic and started swaying to music forever? All that impulsiveness and word salad whenever he speaks? That’s dementia behavior. I’d say that even if he weren’t ideologically opposed to everything in this world I value.

I strongly suspect some of those donors (the ones telling Biden that he HAD to run and was still good to go, and telling the other Democrats that Biden was the only possible choice, so don't even THINK of training and picking replacements) had a lot of money invested into ensuring Biden won, money that they would lose if another Democrat took power, and that they also were expansionist Zionists. Pretty sure that if every one of Biden's top donor/cronies had told him that Gaza needed to be protected even if it hurt Israel a little bit and maybe toppled Netanyahu, Biden would have abandoned Netanyahu. But someone somewhere who made Biden feel loved was telling him to show love to Netanyahu, even at risk of crashing and losing the election in the US. I am NOT saying it was a Jewish cabal.

Depending on the state and the time of polling, Sanders did indeed beat Clinton. What is important are allegations that the Democratic Party apparatus didn't want Sanders to win. I am not sure how you'd prove that, but there are all kinds of signs that the movers and shakers backed Clinton. It would be much harder to prove that this was **not** the case. You know what's even more important? The fact that Democratic primary voters chose Clinton over Sanders.  And pretty handily, too. As Bernie himself admitted: She won because she got more votes. And in 2020, Dem primary voters again chose the moderate candidate, Biden, over Sanders, again by significant margins. Making the ""Democratic establishment"" or the DNC into a bogeyman doesn't override the basic reality that voters repeatedly chose a moderate candidate over a more radical one. My observation is that the left spends an enormous amount of time and energy railing against ""the Democrats"", by which it means a cabal of insiders it imagines are responsible for nominating candidates the left doesn't like -- when in fact, it's voters who are choosing these candidates, time and time again. But to admit this would be to admit that a movement ostensibly about empowering the masses is dissatisfied with the choices made by said masses when they exercise their power... and that's a contradiction most on the left don't seem very interested in grappling with. If you want to empower the masses -- including historically marginalized groups -- you need to face the fact that these folks you consider yourselves advocates for and allies of are, for the most part, not making the choices that you think they should be making. I guess it's easier to blame elites, and even take refuge in conspiracy theories about vote-rigging, than to acknowledge that one's ideology and preferred candidates keep failing to connect with the majority of Democratic voters, and to try to figure out why",9 favorites,['/favorited/2/8712589'],2025-04-15 09:45:00,Tuesday

So I acknowledge the idea that the right can be contained. What I object to, as I stated, was a formulation that excuses right-wing constituents and their representatives from any sort of moral culpability and insists on a political calculus in which they are something more like natural phenomena than like other political actors and political subjects. I also think that's the kind of framing I see from right-wingers describing left wingers and liberals. I don't see much difference between this characterization and the alt-right's use of ""NPC."" It doesn't strike me as doing anything for leftist politics, nor doing anything good for political movements in general. More to the point, as I've stated in the past, I would genuinely welcome someone opposed to the current administration - leftist or liberal or anti-Trump conservartuve or whatever -- discussing what they think their political bloc is doing badly and needs to reexamine, do differently, or question. This does not mean changing goals or moral principles. But it might mean thoroughly rethinking the political tactics involved. I think the left needs to get comfortable with, and get much better at scalable institution-building work, as well as finding ways to make its nascent institutions resilient in the face of structural obstacles and focused opposing action. To the extent I see the populist right as a consequence of the current structure, and its adherents as a sort of epiphenomenon of that structure and its history, I'd have to define every other significant political bloc that way, too. I don't think you can understand the Democratic Party of today without understanding the American Whig Party, the cementing of the post-World War II national consensus that was opposed by both Goldwaterites and the various left and pseudoleft countercultures of those decades. And from there, it's vital to also understand the managed transformation into the neoliberal leadership of the modern Democratic Party, the Washington Consensus, and the perverse ways those and other elements both drew on and created opportunities for the right-wing cultural ecosystem that has now become dominant in governance and new media. And in that story as well are the problems of the left countercultures of eras past, which I refuse to reduce to a problem of betrayal by its allies . To do that it is to say that the left is ncapable of strategy. It, too, becomes merely an innate ethical character besieged by an unethical structure, perhaps an unethical world. I also think that the left is poorly served by yet another argument against liberals. This not because liberals are hunky-dory on their own or harmless or somehow really the left's only true allies or option, but rather because these arguments do not let the left do anything terribly constructive. These arguments merely harden liberal reaction, enthuse right-wingers who read it as weakness or conspiracy, and spend the energy of the left in ways that are emotionally satisfying  but ultimately fruitless and therefore demoralizing. This is why I keep prodding with the question: Given that Democratic leadership is so sclerotic, so neoliberal, so compromised, and so downright shitty, it should be remarkable that they haven't been dislodged or displaced. But they haven't, and we, the left, have not tried to figure out what we can do to make that happen.

To put my cards on the table: I like Bernie pretty well.  I voted for him in the 2016 primaries.  I appreciate what he's doing now. But I also recognize that his brand has repeatedly failed to win over the majority of Democratic voters, let alone the majority of voters generally.  It's particularly notable that in both 2016 and 2020, he couldn't make the sale to most voters of color. This is not me ""relitigating Bernie"".  He's merely a representative of a certain strain of progressivism.  My complaint isn't with him -- I actually think he himself has, for the most part, done a decent job of coalition-building with the center-left, e.g., supporting and encouraging some of the very progressive policies of the Biden administration. It's more with people who think of themselves as Team Sanders, but aren't interested in building coalitions with anyone to their right, and don't seem particularly curious about why so few people agree with them ideologically... and to the extent they ponder such things, always fall back on the idea that their obviously correct agenda is simply being blocked by elite insiders and/or the brainwashing of the masses. Over the last few years, I've been fairly active in my union, and part of what's been interesting (and at times, challenging) about the work I've done is that I've had to learn about people's concerns and meet them where they are, rather than assume I already have all the answers and just have to explain/persuade.  There has to be a real two-way conversation: The union leadership's agenda does need to be explained clearly and convincingly, but we also have to listen to our members, and be willing to reshape plans in response to what they tell us.   That, to me, is the essence of real democracy. This openness to real listening is what I see missing in so much of progressive politics.  It's so often assumed that the solutions have been determined already, and people simply have to be convinced to support them.

As to ""impartiality and evenhandedness,"" that kind of has to be defined as a political, not a legally binding promise. A party also has to be able to state that some people can't run for its nomination, such as members of other parties or people who advocate views with which no political party would want to be associated.

Indeed. And there's good reason to believe that if, say, Jeb Bush (widely seen as the frontrunner before the primary really kicked off) had gotten the nomination, Clinton would have won. The republican party's responsiveness to the most ""radical"" parts of its base, the fact that it is not in fact conservative in the traditional sense here, is part of the reason (apart from gerrymandered districts and the absurd structure of the electoral college and senate) it has managed to stay electorally powerful despite the demographic factors that had some people assuming the GOP would never win a national election again after Obama. But this is kind of the classic structure of liberalism. Radicalism on the right is accomodated and incorporated. Radicalism on the left is stamped out immediately. So the Democratic party is structured to give the establishment final say on nominations, while the GOP is open to ""insurgent"" candidates like Trump",2 favorites,['/favorited/2/8713240'],2025-04-16 14:51:00,Wednesday

What strikes me about Mark Carney is how calm and secure he seems to be. Makes me realize how much of the idiotic behaviour I see from other politicians is driven by insecurity. I’m not even just talking about conservative politicians, either—Justin Trudeau also had some of that “I really want you to like me” class-president over eager energy going on. Watching Mark Carney in an interview makes me feel like he is self-confident and believes he can do a good job but also isn’t overly worried about what people think about him.* Which ironically makes him more likeable, to me anyway. And I really loved it when Nardwuar asked, “Why should people care about Mark Carney?” And he said, “We’re in a crisis. I can fix it. I care about you.” I mean, how simple is that? But when we’re in a crisis, that’s all I really want to hear from the person running my country. *Which is not the same as Donald Trump’s “I don’t care if people think I’m an asshole” personality.

They often don’t fully grasp the context in which it developed, and support it uncritically simply because they assume it’s part of the same ideological team. Unfortunately, the leftist tradition in Latin America is, for the most part, neither democratic nor self-critical. There was never a real reckoning with the failures of Soviet-style communism, nor with Castroism. We also lack a strong tradition of progressivism or democratic socialism. As a result, we keep falling back on outdated models: the caudillo and populism. I understand that there are deeply entrenched interests that need to be dismantled. But I (perhaps naively) believe that the way to do that is by fostering popular participation and strengthening the rule of law—not through concentration of power at the top and the drift toward one-party rule. Which, unfortunately, is more or less where Mexico finds itself today because of AMLO, Sheinbaum and their cronies.

She is, after all, López Obrador’s protégé, and they see him as an analogue to Trump, not an antidote."" so maybe morena is in the mold of leftist maga -- obradorismo as an offshoot of orbanism. but i also take goldberg's other point: And Morena partisans I spoke to are dismissive and a little baffled by accusations that Sheinbaum is traducing democratic principles. “It’s difficult to say that this government and the previous one are not democratic, considering the amount of popularity they have,” said Vanessa Romero Rocha, a lawyer and member of a government committee vetting judges to run for office. An easy riposte is that democracy means more than just elections. But that argument is convincing only if you’ve already accepted that liberal democracy is a superior system, and it’s increasingly clear that many people do not. In elections across the globe, we’re seeing how little many voters care about abstract liberal proceduralism; they’re happy to cede power to the executive branch if they think it will improve their lives. I find this trend tragic, but there are no signs that it’s going to reverse any time soon. Given this reality, we should judge politicians not just on how they amass power, but also on what they do with it. In the United States, centralized authority has allowed Musk, inspired by Argentina’s Milei, to take a metaphorical chain saw to all sorts of federal programs, including those that help the most vulnerable. Sheinbaum, by contrast, is trying to build a national care system for children, the disabled and the elderly, lifting the burden of unpaid labor from many Mexican women. American progressives should be cautious about projecting their desperation for a heroine onto Sheinbaum. But at least right now, her kind of populism looks far better than the alternatives. as (monarchical CEO-apologist) curtis yarvin (https://www.metafilter.com/207818/Engineers-Disease-Writ-Large-Which-Were-All-Now-Suffering-From) pointed out, FDR ran the last US imperial presidency, not always wisely (https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/executive-order-9066/) , but mostly for the greater good. if you don't think the new deal went far enough (https://www.metafilter.com/206746/The-Oligarchy-Is-Coming-How-to-Repair-the-Public-Sphere) , though, and see where stalinism took russia (https://archive.is/jZjaH) as a cautionary tale, i think it's worth watching whether sheinbaum can steer mexico beyond those bounds? and as a first step, like beck and goldberg acknowledge, getting a leg up on neoliberalism is no small thing: HB (https://apricot-edeline-79.tiiny.site/) : Despite numerous failures in various areas of public administration, AMLO managed to consolidate his main political strength during his six years in power (Mexican presidents are limited to a single term): the cultivation of a powerful image of symbolic restitution for Mexico’s marginalized majorities. In the 2024 federal elections, the Mexican electorate rewarded Morena with another term partly due to the effectiveness of this image, but also because of its material foundation in a series of public policies that have had concrete positive effects for substantial sectors of the population. It is to these policies, including a sustained increase in the minimum wage and a series of social programs based on the provision of cash to vulnerable groups, that we must attribute the main achievement of Obradorismo in power: a moderate, but certainly significant, reduction in poverty. MG (https://archive.is/MKWIi) : As president, López Obrador more than doubled the minimum wage and pegged it to inflation to ensure that workers wouldn’t fall behind. He enacted broad social programs, including stipends for young people doing job training and, most important, universal cash transfers for the elderly. According to Mexico’s National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy, five million Mexicans escaped poverty during the first four years of his presidency. (Extreme poverty, however, increased by nearly half a million.) Ahead of the last election in 2024, a Gallup poll found that Mexicans were more optimistic about improvements in their own living standards than at any other time since Gallup began surveying the country. Some Mexican economists see their country’s expanded welfare state, which Sheinbaum hopes to grow further, as unsustainable. They note that López Obrador didn’t raise taxes on the rich to pay for it, instead relying on deficit spending and severe cuts to other parts of the government. Overall economic growth was slow during his presidency, and the health care system declined precipitously. Carlos Heredia, a left-leaning Mexican economist and onetime adviser to López Obrador, criticizes the former president for handing out money rather than investing in education and, especially, health care. “Instead of establishing and improving a functioning system that belongs to the users,” Heredia said, “what we have is a disaster.” But whatever the argument against cash transfers as policy, they are excellent politics. Money in people’s pockets is simply more tangible than even the wisest improvements in public services. Francisco Abundis, the director of the public opinion research firm Parametrics, told me that by giving people cash, López Obrador’s administration also gave them a measure of self-respect, a feeling of being seen and valued by their government. Retirees, he said, gained independence and enhanced status within their families from their ability to contribute. “It was a matter of dignity, the role they play,” he said. During López Obrador’s presidency, said Abundis, about one of every four Mexican adults had received government aid, but that support also benefited their relatives, so 48 percent of people who went to the polls last year said they’d received money from the government. Mexico’s voters, then, weren’t looking for change last year",4 favorites,"['https://www.metafilter.com/208318/Mexicos-4th-transformation-like-if-AOC-was-prez-after-Sanders-admin#8709021', 'https://www.metafilter.com/208127/Trump-urges-Supreme-Court-to-limit-judges-power-to-impede-his-agenda#8702978', 'https://apricot-edeline-79.tiiny.site/', 'https://www.metafilter.com/208318/Mexicos-4th-transformation-like-if-AOC-was-prez-after-Sanders-admin#8709135', 'https://thepolitic.org/democracy-in-distress-how-mexicos-judiciary-lost-its-independence/', 'https://www.metafilter.com/208020/Chinese-Democracy', 'https://theconversation.com/what-remains-of-operation-car-wash-brazils-historic-anti-corruption-probe-236275', 'https://archive.is/jHXGw', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/politics/government/brazil-puts-former-president-bolsonaro-on-trial-for-allegedly-plotting-coup/ar-AA1BI3QI', 'https://www.metafilter.com/206240/Their-echo-chamber-doubles-as-this-countrys-largest-media-networks#8648165', 'https://www.ojala.mx/en/ojala-en/the-trouble-with-claudia-sheinbaum', 'https://archive.is/MKWIi', 'https://www.metafilter.com/207818/Engineers-Disease-Writ-Large-Which-Were-All-Now-Suffering-From', 'https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/executive-order-9066/', 'https://www.metafilter.com/206746/The-Oligarchy-Is-Coming-How-to-Repair-the-Public-Sphere', 'https://archive.is/jZjaH', 'https://apricot-edeline-79.tiiny.site/', 'https://archive.is/MKWIi', '/favorited/2/8709482']",2025-04-08 00:41:00,Tuesday

Next thing you know everybody is walking around with a pair of hot dogs on their faces and talking about how they need a touch-up. Likewise once everybody's got a fake tan it throws off your internal white balance, so you've always got to go just a shade darker to stand out from the crowd. As much as it's about conformity, it's also about standing out competitively in your commitment to conformity. You've got to look... really outstandingly just the same as everybody else?

Surgeries that significantly, noticeably alter people's bodies and faces are very trendy among many subcultures right now! Surgeries that very clearly and obviously create shapes and forms that would not occur without surgery! To say nothing of the ubiquity of exercise programs, food restrictions, and medications legal and not to dramatically alter our physical forms. Social critique is fine and good. We should wonder why we do the things we do and how sexism etc plays a role in that. But this article is just not convincing to me because very noticeable surgeries are in no way specific to Trump's circle. I would be interested in delving in to the idea that these surgeries have a fascist aesthetic, but I'd need an argument that takes into account the popularity of many different ""overt"" surgeries among many populations right now.

In the non-MAGA world, women wear makeup, sometimes a lot (half of the articles in women’s mags when I was young were about getting your hair and makeup routine down to “only” 30 minutes or whatever.) Women restrict calories to conform to a body type. They endure painful procedures—laser hair removal, waxing, shaving, peels, hair dye, extensions, injections. I am firmly of the opinion that the women I see caked in makeup are not more beautiful than they would be if they went bare-faced. They are only signaling compliance, and men respond to this. Men are not bothered, for example, by a woman’s wearing high heels—they think it’s sexy. They don’t viscerally wince at women hobbling themselves, or ripping out all their hair, to be more appealing. The grotesque extreme of this is the Republican standard of beauty, because republican women know better than anyone that their power and resources are dependent on men’s approval. As do most of us women, but some of us are trying to resist at least a little. And I say this as someone who herself tries to conform to a feminine standard of beauty and am bothered that a lot of aging is necessarily a failure to meet those standards",23 favorites,['/favorited/2/8708302'],2025-04-05 04:50:00,Saturday

For Marcotte, it's all about submission. Just like Trump & his people are trying to force us to accept lies as the truth and what is evil as what is good, Trump World is shoving ugliness in our faces & daring us to deny that is what it is. The article has a great quote from a Bluesky post (https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qgz7jtmlddfn3dikhimzlqu5/post/3ll3fvly4422z?ref_src=embed&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.salon.com%252F2025%252F03%252F24%252Ffrom-mar-a-lago-face-to-uncanny-ai-art-magas-love-of-ugliness-is-submission-to%252F) from Kat Tenbarge: A lot of people have said that the women in particular looked better before the surgery. I’ve done a fair bit of reporting on modern plastic surgery culture and looking “better” is often not the point. It’s about looking different, looking strange, because it causes people to pay more attention. I think this is what differentiates Mar-a-Lago face from the more subtle forms of plastic surgery that some women have used in order to protect themselves against ageism, racism, and sexism in the labor market. Mar-a-Lago face deliberately calls attention to itself & it calls attention to itself because it is meant to signal buy-in with a specific political, cultural, and aesthetic project. You can call out that project itself as ugly without necessarily having to shame how women look in the process",6 favorites,"['https://www.salon.com/2025/03/24/from-mar-a-lago-face-to-uncanny-ai-art-magas-love-of-ugliness-is-submission-to/', 'https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qgz7jtmlddfn3dikhimzlqu5/post/3ll3fvly4422z?ref_src=embed&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.salon.com%252F2025%252F03%252F24%252Ffrom-mar-a-lago-face-to-uncanny-ai-art-magas-love-of-ugliness-is-submission-to%252F', '/favorited/2/8708390']",2025-04-05 10:40:00,Saturday

https://www.metafilter.com/208297/The-face-of-evil,symbioid,https://www.metafilter.com/user/19789,"Is there some abstract connection between the rise of conspicuous hair dye and the rise of conspicuous cosmetic surgery? It isn't especially the same people or the same era, but there might be a similar process. Is this referring to the 90s ""Manic Panic"" type bright colors?  I think it's just a combination of people who loved punk, and colors and self-expression (see also the big Neon Green/Hot Pink phase at the end of the 80s).  Maybe it's a way for the 80s spandex LA Rock scene to have influence even after Grunge killed it.  There's also a lot of fun funk bands that were very colorful coming from LA.  What's also interesting (to me) is that I sorta see the Kardashians as a forerunner of this look, the bronzed look (obviously Trump's orange thing is a hollow empty parody of it; as if a colorblind guy tried to apply makeup to himself and failed hard)...  But I kinda hated how big EVERYONE tried to look like Kardashians for a while.  I'm not saying Kardashians are nearly as bad, and in fact, I kinda regret thinking of their look as a ""Tragedy""...  because now we see the ""Farce"". Is the idea here some sort of ""evo-psych"" thing where I kinda implied that the point is to look bad and get away with it, haha, we have such bad taste and you poor suckers have to stare at us.  (I mean I doubt they think consciously this way, but come on, deep down, they HAVE to recognize how awful it is).  But I think the thing with Manic Panic is - while maybe more staid traditionalists dislike bright colored hair, in general, unless you do a poor job at it, it doesn't necessarily look ""bad"" just ""different"".  (Yes, aesthetics isn't ""objective"" but come on guys, there's certainly a threshold). I think the difference there would be, most people don't have a problem with dyed hair in the same ""WTF AM I LOOKING OH AVERT THY GAZE"" way that MALface seems to bring to the table.  IN that sense the horror of this trend is the evo-psych thing.  It IS ""look at me! I can do 'crazy, radical' things""  and maybe... maybe... Maybe now that colored hair isn't actually that big of a deal after the 90s... So it's easier to put rose-tinted glasses on and see retroactively like 'oh yeah not a big deal' - but at the time maybe it was?  I was IN it so to me it felt natural (all my friends were punks, goths, skaters, rivetheads (amongst others)).  But to the normies, I guess yeah. Maybe the reaction by normies in the 90s was ""WOAH WHAT IS THIS?  BLUE HAIR!????"" in the same way I say ""WOAH WHAT IS THIS?  A HARPIE?"" It also could be there's something in the power of these people's minds that cause strong body dysmorphia?  Or maybe they have a ""perfect"" image in their mind that they want to attain, do a little, then, it seems (like a lot of these ""plastic surgery disasters"" which hey, JELLO BIAFRA - RELEASE a remake/new version with updated lyrics - PSD II!) as I was saying - maybe they got caught by the plastic surgery bug and one fucked up ""improvement"" leads to you having to do the whole shebang, and you have no idea where to stop (or like spot cleaning). Just one more nip/tuck.  It also makes a statement on wealth - ""oh honey - to look this bad - you have GOT to spend a LOT of money"" I also think I have way too many opinions about appearances in a culture I should have no fucks to give about.

Far more people than you think, and most of the time you won't even know it. 2.) lots of people wear makeup, and sometimes they wear more than you might like. That's okay- it is their choice, and they are allowed to do what they want. It doesn't mean they are white trash, or are pawns of the patriarchy. Related: many people who do not look like they are wearing makeup, are in fact wearing as much or more than people with obvious lip liner and false eyelashes. It's all about the application. 3.) Judging people for the way they look is a minefield. It is entirely possible to despise fascists without bagging on their looks. I know people will rush to argue with this, saying public assholes deserve to have their looks judged. Okay, but it's still more useful and effective to describe the actual things they are doing to hurt people. And there are people in the world who are kind and sympathetic and not fascist, who have made poor choices in how they present themselves, or don't have money or skill to make themselves look different than the women featured in the article. 4.) It is possible to have this discussion about why these particular people have made the choices they have without being misogynist and/or classist. Not everyone here is succeeding at this. I tend to think that the way these people present themselves points more to the fact that they are all self absorbed assholes who manage to drive away anyone with finesse, intelligence, taste and/or a sense of humanity or kindness. Furthermore, they disdain expertise and don't want to pay for things, so all the people around them by choice are syncophantic grifters. In short, they aren't getting the best advice, the best care, or the best of anything even though they're generally rich and want to give the appearance of wealth and class. They're not going to go to anyplace that might be ""woke"", and are likely such shitty customers that they can't get services from people that are truly good at their jobs. Yes, they are also poisoned by society's insistence that women remain youthful, thin, large breasted, long-haired, and compliant with norms. But there are a lot of people in this thread that are hinting at those same expectations in their comments. Rather then insisting people uphold a different set of norms one approves of, maybe allow people to look how they want in the way they can best manage, and judge people's actions. Some of your children are going to grow up and want to wear makeup and jewelry and dye their hair weird colors and wear high heels.

While I am no sort of expert in Korean politics, there seem to be maybe 3 main theories: a) he was frustrated at his inability to work with parliament (controlled by the opposition), b) he was trying to get out from under corruption investigations, and c) he believed that he was fighting North Korean infiltration because either he had special information (if you’re a supporter) or he spent way too much time listening to conspiracy-mongering right wing media (if you’re a detractor). I suspect he also gave in to the fascist/authoritarian urge to take bold action rather than see what develops. In the last case, the martial law was ill-planned and tepidly executed, suggesting a spur-of-the-moment decision.

This is a hallmark of the sovereign citizen movement who claim the United States can’t legally make laws because the flags in courtrooms have gold fringe. And, frankly, that might be the next argument advanced by the DOJ — the term is still young! As you might imagine, no, this is not how the law works. While a private individual might be able to take a boat into the middle of the ocean to sell trafficked panda meat or something, there is no legal basis for the United States government violating a United States court order simply because the plane — still fully within the command of the United States government — has ventured into the Gulf of Mexico. The Court order applies to the government and the government is still very much here. and They didn’t actually set out to defy a court order. “We wanted them on the ground first, before a judge could get the case, but this is how it worked out,” said the official. Yeah, see, that still violates the court order. The government would still have to return the prisoners to run through the existing justice process here even if they’d been assigned bunks in El Salvador’s slave camp. Because, contrary to administration claims that this is about foreign affairs, this is an immigration issue and until these people are actually CONVICTED of something, the government can only detain them for immigration processing and deport them. They cannot, for example, sell defendants to a foreign prison system!

Trump administration lawyers have determined that an 18th-century wartime law the president has invoked to deport suspected members of a Venezuelan gang allows federal agents to enter homes without a warrant, according to people familiar with internal discussions. The disclosure reflects the Trump administration’s aggressive view of presidential power, including setting aside a key provision of the Fourth Amendment that requires a court order to search someone’s home. It remains unclear whether the administration will apply the law in this way, but experts say such an interpretation would infringe on basic civil liberties and raise the potential for misuse. Warrantless entries have some precedent in America’s wartime history, but invoking the law in peacetime to pursue undocumented immigrants in such a way would be an entirely new application, they added. “It undermines fundamental protections that are recognized in the Fourth Amendment, and in the due process clause,” said Christopher Slobogin, a law professor at Vanderbilt University",4 favorites,"['https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/trump-alien-enemies-immigration-agents.html?unlocked_article_code=1.5U4.39cB.wD5EgfXixxmS&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare&sgrp=p', '/favorited/2/8702084']",2025-03-20 16:06:00,Thursday

https://www.metafilter.com/208107/The-proof-is-not-in-the-pudding,Violet Blue,https://www.metafilter.com/user/115736,"I have repeatedly wondered if Trump could be charged with treason. According to this definition, it certainly looks like a theoretical possibility. Definition: In Article III, Section 3 of the United States Constitution, treason is specifically limited to levying war against the U.S., or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_laws_in_the_United_States) . Penalty: Under U.S. Code Title 18, the penalty is death, or not less than five years' imprisonment (with a minimum fine of $10,000, if not sentenced to death). Any person convicted of treason against the United States also forfeits the right to hold public office in the United States. The terms used in the definition derive from English legal tradition, specifically the Treason Act 1351. Levying war means the assembly of armed people to overthrow the government or to resist its laws . Enemies are subjects of a foreign government that is in open hostility with the United States. Treason does not distinguish between participants and accessories; all persons who rebel or intentionally give aid to hostilities are subject to the same charge. Death sentences for treason under the Constitution have been carried out in only two instances: the executions of Taos Revolt insurgents in 1847, and that of William Bruce Mumford during the Civil War. A handful of other people convicted of the offense at the federal level – such as two militants from the Whiskey Rebellion (John Mitchell and Philip Weigel, who were both pardoned by President George Washington) and several people after World War II – have mostly been pardoned or released. The last federal treason conviction to be fully upheld was that of Nazi sympathizer Herbert John Burgman in 1949",1 favorite,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_laws_in_the_United_States', '/favorited/2/8702306']",2025-03-21 13:42:00,Friday
https://www.metafilter.com/208107/The-proof-is-not-in-the-pudding,sotonohito,https://www.metafilter.com/user/17651,"At this point its pretty obvious that Trump et al are playing chicken with mass civil unrest if not actual civil war. I'm doubtful they actually want civil war, wars are chancy things after all and in a place like the modern US there's no geographic divide, not like back in the 1860's. It'd be more like Rwanda with roving gangs on each side murdering suspected members of the other side. We do have one really strange advantage here that we've never had before in any other major upset in US politics: something local to protest. One major problem with protest in the US is that the nation is too big for most people who want to protest to find a way to get to DC and actually register their displeasure by joining a big protest. So protest movements tended to be brief, have not nearly as many people as actually oppose the thing, and can be easily ignored because they're a flash and then they sputter out. Not that this keeps them from sending the pigs in to assault protesters, but they're doing that because they like to, not because they need to. Except now? Elon Musk is the public face of all this, to an extent even more than Trump himself, and Musk has a Tesla showroom within driving distance of a huge number of protest minded Americans. Which means the protests can be bigger, widespread, show larger numbers, and be ongoing. It's a unique advantage, and I hope the Tesla protests continue. I'm not endorsing the vandalism and property destruction, but the ongoing massive disruptive protests should keep on going. Likewise people giving Cybertruck owners the bird and otherwise harassing them should keep going. Not because any of that has an actual direct impact on any policy, but because it shows that the level of civil unrest is high, and growing, and they should veer off instead of going on. In a game of chicken the first one to pull away loses, unless of course everyone loses because no one will give in and so there's a crash. Or civil war in our metaphoric game of chicken. And in the meantime things will keep getting worse, and people will keep getting hurt or killed or sent off to be slave labor for the dictator of El Salvador. The only good news is that we might, possibly, be able to protest Tesla enough that they decide they've hit the sticking point (this time) and to back off (for a little bit). And maybe we survive with a government that's vaguely functional until 2026 and 2028. In that good timeline we face the monumental challenge of etching change into stone with hardcore enforcement that they cannot ignore before we lose the next election. And I'm not sure the Democrats are up to it. Maybe the forced exercise during these times will stiffen their spines. We don't need me to belabor what happens in the bad timeline. I'd urge everyone to give serious thought to what you'll actually do, not internet bravado do, but ACTUALLY do in that bad timeline and prepare accordingly. More generally, I've been thinking, and there's a real reason why this budget stuff is hitting everyone so viscerally. It's probably something most other people realized a long time ago, or always knew. But just in case I'm not the only one who hadn't put it together: Money is how a government does things, so the budget is of critical importance. As a result our budget is a godawful kludge of a mess that no one likes. It has stuff the Republicans hate, it has stuff the Democrats hate, it has not nearly as much money for the stuff the Republicans like and not nearly as much for the stuff the Democrats like. It's a messy compromise that leaves everyone unhappy and dissatisfied. But it was.... tolerable. Only the most insignificant minority saw that budget and said that the government had abandoned them and the America they had agreed to be part of was no longer there and so the nation lurched onward with a balance of displeasure. We had a deal, America could keep existing as long as the budget was tolerable. But here's Trump with the one weird trick that liberals hate to undo that, to toss out the entire budget and rewrite the rules so they read: ""I get everything, you get nothing"". That's why DOGE feels so viscerally threatening. It's because it is. That's how Trump and the Republicans are breaking the deal. It's how they're throwing out the ugly compromise of a budget that you really really hated but could tolerate, and what they're putting in place is going to be intolerable.

How? You can file a bar grievance for whatever reason you want.  Hair is parted wrong.  BUT one should make 'em  actually be valid. Each State has its own rules but they generally follow the ABA sample (https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/) .  By searching on your search engine of choice one can find the reporting forms for judicial misconduct and filing a bar grievance. For the 'we have no evidence but that just shows how criminal they are by successfully hiding the evidence' the violations for the person presenting that would be a violation of how a lawyer is to only put forth arguments that are supported by law or statute UNLESS the lawyer is arguing for a change in law.  In a law firm the senior partners are to supervise the juniors so one can file a complaint for all senior people that they failed to supervise the lawyer who made the argument.  Nothing says love in the workplace like you getting a complaint about what the law dog did over there and you have nothing to do with it at all. Understand a valid complaint by a citizen will eventually get a letter saying 'we found no violation'.  The insurance firms know this and that's why they treat the filing of one as having a  level of validity.  1st year in practice and you get a grievance and you are uninsurable.  A firm gets 3 in a year - same effect.  To help the insurance firms evaluate the risk make sure to blind copy all of them licensed in the state  as how can you know which one is covering them. Each bar complaint needs the lawyer to respond.  That can be as low as 10 hours of their now non billable time and can get well over 120 hours which is why the complaint should be based on the rules violation VS hair parting or 'they are defending a nazi',  A past bar card holder made a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSPJkE2LBH4) about the complaints he got and cited only because it is rare for lawyers to talk about it or show them.  Complaints like those he cited won't go as far as conduct in cases and the kinds of conduct that will get a lawyer nailed hard is trust fund management.  I know personally of law firms that dissolved over complaints and lawyers who keep their bar card but don't practice due to lack of being insurable. Judges are a bit different.  The conduct complaint just makes it harder for them to get promoted and something for an opponent to run against.  For promotional purposes people with no complaints are more likely to get the promotion.   The only outside force is the bond company backing the county so sending a complaint copy there might have an effect. A final 'as a citizen' note:  Go read your States Code of Criminal Procedure.  Most States have a way for a citizen to bypass the cops for filing a criminal complaint.   California and New York used to have online manuals for the Grand Juries informing the members about how citizens can make presentments and admonished the Grand Jury members to treat them the same as one from the DA.  Other States allow the criminal complaint to be placed in font of a Judge or DA.  Nothing is stopping citizens from making criminal charges VS the companies of Lo T and Prez E AND the elected officials would have plausible deniability with  ""a citizen went to the Grand Jury and the citizens of the Grand Jury said there was a crime here so I'm just doing my job as DA prosecuting this case.""  After WWII the Federal Grand Juries got a French inspired reform from punishment to rehabilitation.  In that reform the ability of citizens to go to a Federal Grand Jury was removed by policy.  What else happened back then was black soldiers on liberty boats heard about the laws which protected them as noted in one now dead black Congressman's book about his life as that is how he became interested him eventually ending up in Congress.  While there is not produced for the public documentation showing the reform of direct citizen presentment was done explicitly, in part,  to prevent blacks from going to Federal Grand Juries given Jim Crow there is a high probability the reform was done to prevent such.

He's shifting what government does away from providing services and towards the machinery of ICE which will soon become the machinery of suppressing internal dissent; and away from soft power and economic power and towards military power; and increasing and accelerating the already existing trend of increased government surveillance (in this case carried out by private corporations allied with government, like musk's Starlink and twitter, and Facebook).

In Right-Wing Women, Dworkin attacked sex work, pornography, and reproductive technology with the same ferocity she applied to Schlafly’s ilk. “Motherhood is becoming a new branch of female prostitution with the help of scientists who want access to the womb for experimentation and power,” she wrote, but the truth is somewhat more complex. For conservatives who defend technologies like IVF, science is another way to bind women to motherhood, but it can also detach reproduction from compulsory heterosexuality, and it offers women a way to bear children on their own terms, which is why it has always been in danger from some factions of the right wing. Dworkin admitted the irony, but as with her fight against pornography, she stood firmly on reactionary ground. If there is a gynocide to come, as she feared, it would be carried out by the same forces who want to ban IVF, pornography, and sex work. ' Obviously I disagree with the idea that Dworkin was somehow pushed into a reactionary role--two opposing groups can be against the same thing, for different reasons.  Patriarchy wants to have things both ways:  It wants to put you in a box and judge you for having chosen to be in the box because the box is bad and a sin. To admit the box is bad isn't patriarchal",8 favorites,['/favorited/2/8700582'],2025-03-17 13:38:00,Monday

She's been misquoted and had quotes taken out of context that have created a FakeDworken which is all most people know about her. Take, for example, the lie that she believed all heterosexual sex was rape. In fact ""all heterosexual intercourse is rape"" is sometimes presented as if it was an actual quote from Dworkin which is completely untrue. She did write: ""Under male supremacy, the meaning of intercourse can hardly be distinguished from the meaning of rape."" And I think it's difficult to dispute that statement. Especially when you consider that at the time she said it marital rape was not a crime in many US states and it was a bitter uphill battle to criminalize it. And for all that I think porn and even sex work can be non-harmful or non-misogynist I can't dispute that a whole lot of porn is extremely misogynistic and while there is capitalism there are legitimate questions about the actual consent of sex workers. But. While I argue that she is often mischaracterized and even slandered by her detractors, I also think she made some poor if understandable  political decisions. Aligning herself with the extremely misogynist religious right, no matter how theoretically single issue focused that alliance might have been, strikes me as harmful to her cause. And while she never said that alliance was wrong, she did later acknowledge that it hadn't produced any favorable results. At the time I was a young man, and only just edging my way into feminism, and like many younger liberals of the era I thought she had betrayed her principles by working with the right. Today I'm less confident that is true. I'm still not convinced that banning pornography would produce any positive results and that the free speech harm it would cause would almost certainly be worse than any feminist benefits. But I think a lot of her views on a violent misogy in porn have been throughly and empirically confirmed by the vast quantity of violent misogynistic pornography that we see today. The fact that she's a second wave feminist who did NOT get into bioessentialism, and was in fact supportive of trans people, is pretty significant and is a big part of her core philosophic argument. She saw systemic oppression as the result of a system rather than the result of ""uncontrollable biological impulses"" or whatever. In a lot of ways her feminism looks more third wave than second, and while she died before Rowing went full TERF I'm pretty sure she would have firmly rejected the bioessentialism at their core and condemned Rowling for her own association with the right wing.

Republicans see this as a win win already, so they just aren't negotiating. I'm all for hardball and brinkmanship, but I don't know how. You have to be able to hurt something they care about.

CHIP offers low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Republicans ruled out cuts to Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors that leaders cut at their political peril. Medicare is about 15% of the federal budget, and Medicaid is about 8.6%. When Medicare is set aside, Medicaid accounts for 93% of the funding under the committee’s jurisdiction, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found in a March 5 analysis.

""Take all the blame"" is like a parody of a Sunday morning-show Republican talking point. The Democrats offer a path to keep the government open with one proposal, the Republicans offer a different one. Neither side votes for the other's. Who's to blame? In this case the Democrats could have picked from a set of relatively minimalist, popular demands.  ""We are eager to keep the government open but the Republicans insist on the right to cut cancer research,"" for example. Even the relatively timid ""we have a 1-page continuing resolution to authorize the government to open at any time; what the Republicans refuse to vote on anything that doesn't include 100 pages of goodies for Musk and his techbros"" would be better than what we're getting. If you don't think this is situation where the Democrats have the best chance of getting strong public support and highlighting the illegal acts, I'd love to hear what opportunity you think is coming up. AFAICT the backup plan is basically rooting that the economy craters and hoping that changes public opinion.

Those afraid of a shutdown are discussing electoral consequences in 2026. Polls are measuring who would be blamed in the polls. This is a very stupid analysis. Yes, Schumer et al are worried about a shutdown being blamed on Democrats and how that could impact the 2026 midterms. House Democrats who are calling for primaries of Dem senators who vote for cloture and/or the CR are doing so not because they're worried about the 2026 midterms; they're doing so because Democratic leadership has become so incredibly feckless that they want to burn leadership to the ground and start over.

Made this point again and again and again in the past, but I'm gonna make it again now because people online keep not being able to understand it: the whole ""being ruled by tweets, and they're stupid tweets"" situation is the details that ordinary working people are not paying attention to. Most people give no shits at all about politics. For most people, ""politics"" is merely one of the two well-known labels (""religion"" is the other) for taboo topics that are never to be brought up in polite company lest it stop being polite and fights ensue. That is as far as they care to engage with it and that remains the case regardless of how incomprehensible this state of affairs might seem to the extremely online. The general public still has no idea at all how badly TFG and his gang of sycophants and enablers (https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) are screwing us all. Even when actively and personally being screwed, most people will blame that on the government or the politicians rather than engage in any kind of analysis about what kind of government and which politicians. Most people cannot correctly outline any party's actual policy on any issue despite how quickly they will claim policy preferences as the basis for supporting one figurehead over another. So at this point in history it is the duty of those of us who do pay attention to political developments to break that taboo and start bringing politics up in polite company.

Relevant section below, my emphasis in bold : SEC. 4003. POLICY STATEMENT ON GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION: (a) FINDINGS .—The House finds the following: (1) Regulations throughout the Federal Government have been a major issue for decades, continuously growing while negatively impacting the nation’s economic and fiscal standing. (2) Overregulation has consistently hurt small businesses, strangled domestic energy production, weakened labor market conditions, and expanded government overreach and costs on taxpayers. (3) Real (inflation-adjusted) spending on regulatory agencies has increased exponentially since 1960. The total number of pages in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has increased from 2,877 pages in 1960 to nearly 200,000 today.When compared to 1950, the CFR contained only 9,745 pages in 1950, making the size of the CFR today 95% larger than it was in 1950. (b) POLICY STATEMENT ON GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION . -It is the policy of this concurrent resolution—(1) that Congress continues to examine ways to relieve the burdens of overregulation throughout the Federal Government;(2) that Congress is ready to promote initiatives that will reduce government bureaucracy, enhance Federalism, and increase economic prosperity through deregulation;(3) to not only reduce burdensome, costly regulations, but to also reassert the role of Congress; and (4) to enact legislation through reconciliation that strengthens Congress, scales back Federal regulations, limits future bureaucratic red tape, and unleashes economic growth, such as the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act. The language in the proposed budget resolution is an insane power grab. Passing legislation via reconciliation means simple majority which means absolute Republican power. No filibuster possibility, no need for any other party's votes, no compromise. All the screaming and media drama about the CR feels like such a shiny ball distraction.

Not really. First, most people who are only vaguely aware of politics just know ""President = Trump"" so he's going to take most of the heat for economic problems because in their minds the president controls the economy like a controller at a switchboard. So economy bad = president bad. Second, for the people who are less vaguely aware of politics and might be convinced by ""Democrats caused this!"", the Democrats need get off their butts and get out there and say ""The Republicans control 4 branches of government!

So, good luck presenting a united front on anything from here on out! This is a gigantic failure in leadership on Schumer's part. Finally, the Republicans now know they can just do this again next time. They pass a budget, the House walks off, the Senate Democrats flop, and the next CR bill passes despite a token Democratic no vote. I mean, what was the point of all the talk of ""We need the filibuster for later!"" talk about from Senate Dems if not for now, when it's essentially the only leverage we have left along with presenting a united front?

Contrast that with the flimsy, fractious big-tent Democrats who are just snapping at each other as they're being steamrollered. To me, the only effective public opposition to Trump will come from a broad alliance of average Americans from both parties,  who are willing to put aside party loyalties to come together to protest and to fight back against the economic and structural damage that Trump has unleashed. You need angry Republicans phoning the Republican congresspeople and Senators they elected, demanding a halt to the Project 2025 madness.

And it wasn't the ""GOP"" who lost previous filibuster shutdown battles, it was the party doing the filibuster. > House Democrats essentially stuck together It was a two-step trap. Blocking the bill in the House would have meant there was no bill for the Dems to filibuster. That's great! It's normal for bills to fail in the House and the Speaker would have to stay in DC to get things worked out, including possibly needing to work with the Dems to overcome his own caucus problems. But once it got to the Senate,  voting no on cloture meant all non-essential (as determined by Russell Vought (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/key-project-2025-authors-now-staffing-trump-administration-rcna195107) and Elon Musk's people) Federal workers get fired as the shutdown goes on, and it's all blamed on the 40+ filibusterers who are actively blocking the House bill. >""We need the filibuster for later!"" talk about from Senate Dems if not for now, when it's essentially the only leverage we have left along with presenting a united front Like I said above, this wasn't a normal filibuster where the table resets. The Federal government is getting cut one way or another, and the filibuster is actually the accelerationist approach.

All I can say is that my impression is that every time in the past when the GOP has played brinksmanship with a shutdown folks on here trot out all kinds of polls showing how much people disapprove of it when it happens and GOP pols all take big approval hits. All most people know is that the Federal government is shutdown and that's bad.  Then they see one party trying to get the government running and the other keeping it shutdown so they blame it on the party keeping things shutdown.  Or they just convince themselves yet again that all politicians are terrible and it's just not worth being involved. I don't know the answer here, I just know that I'm very hesitant to jump on team ""allowing this CR to pass is a betrayal"" over it.  I wish that I could count on all the non-mefites of the country to be engaged enough to know who the real enemy is here but after this last election I count on most folks to be somewhere between ""disengaged to the extent it's actively harmful"" and ""are just assholes."" Following that assumption, avoiding a shutdown is probably the better move.  Pointing out the GOP does this shit just to play politics with stuff that should not be played with doesn't seem to help anything.

He knows that Trump 47 is not Trump 45.  The Trump 47 team is fully committed to, and believes it has a mandate to achieve, a sharp reduction of federally-enforced regulation and federally-provided services, in way that no post-FDR Republican other than Reagan in his first campaign has even pretended to be, to say the least of actually been. The shutdown would have given OMB (and through it, DOGE) a completely kosher right to take very large steps that the CR, once enacted, would not permit - shutting down any non-entitlement program they want to shut down, and firing anyone they want to fire, including staff functionally essential for the administration of entitlements or for enforcing laws and regulations that Trump can't directly rescind.  All the judicial challenges to impoundment of duly appropriated funds ... dead.  No court can mandate the enforcement of a regulation the relevant regulator of which is furloughed, nor would any court have the right to recall a furloughed regulator in the absence of funds to pay him. And the political realities here are not simple.  There are a lot of people who don't like federally-enforced regulations and doing away with them can win a lot of friends and be very hard to reverse.  There are a lot of people who aren't fans of federal services (for other people...) and will be happy to see them go away, and, once again, hard to bring them back. People who live in blue states really should devote a lot more energy to adopting state-level regulations and program to mirror the most targeted federal regulations and programs, and to finding the votes in Congress to transform as much of the related federal spending into block grants their states can use to implement the programs and regulations.  Federal tax cuts can provide room for new state taxes for those services and regulations without increasing the overall tax burden.  (Presumably the people who haven't already moved to Texas and Florida for lower overall taxes, won't move there if their taxes aren't going up all-in.)",9 favorites,['/favorited/2/8699868'],2025-03-15 10:56:00,Saturday

Option A: Project 2025 fires everybody they want now, and more in October. It's flagrantly illegal. Maybe the Supreme Court steps in to stop it (there are some indications (https://abovethelaw.com/2024/06/amy-coney-barrett-is-sick-of-the-supreme-courts-bullsht/) that ACB is actually more of an independent thinker than the Federalist Society wanted her to be (https://www.newsweek.com/president-donald-trump-amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-scotus-presidential-immunity-jan-6-2040765) , and John Roberts may not be a centrist, exactly, but he's still very attached to playing one on TV); maybe they don't, in which case the last resort is the court of public opinion, which is already vocally against Musk and his DOGE stooges. Bonus: the Democrats get to at least look like they're actually trying to fight this, which will help their already-badly-damaged credibility and ability to grassroots fundraise in 2028 and beyond. Option B: Project 2025 fires everybody they want now, and more in October. The legal challenges against this are undermined by a CR that gives Trump both tacit approval and a slush fund to play with. The legal challenges being weakened hurts the pushback against this in the court of public opinion as well. Bonus: the Democrats look like feckless cowards who spent all of 2024 railing against the fascist takeover of our government only to then spend 2025 doing their very best impression of Vichy France; this hurts their already-badly-damaged credibility and ability to grassroots fundraise in 2028 and beyond. Schumer decided to go with option B, because Schumer is fundamentally a coward who is averse to any kind of real confrontation, and doesn't understand, or doesn't want to understand, that the longer Trump's illegal power-grab goes without being confronted, the harder it will be to confront. The fact that you apparently still cannot see the difference between Option A and Option B does not mean that there isn't a difference, it just means you may not be as perceptive as you seem to think you are.

People are mad at the Democrats because people want: (1) To believe that someone can magically fix things, and (2) Somebody to be mad at for not magically fixing things. There was no good alternative with the CR.  People wanted to believe that a government shutdown was a powerful tool -- hell, for a while, I wanted to believe it -- but having seen the GOP play that card over and over again for the past few decades, my biggest takeaways are that it is fundamentally a tool of destruction, and that it has never, ever worked out the way the GOP has hoped it would.  It has backfired on them every damn time.  And it would have backfired on the Dems too. In this case, I suspect it would probably have put the Dems on an equal footing with the GOP in the eyes of much of the public, i.e, as wreckers of government.  That is not a brand the Democratic Party should adopt, IMHO, especially now. I also agree that it would render a lot of the ongoing litigation over firings and impoundment moot, and likely let Trump and Musk accomplish their goals more easily. What it ultimately comes down to, as torokunai2 emphasized, is that the American people did a very, very stupid thing last November.

Let me explain. When we see someone who doesn't look like us, or sound like us, or act like us, or love like us, or live like us, the first thought that crosses almost everyone's brain is rooted in either fear or judgement or both. That's evolution. We survived as a species by being suspicious of things that we aren't familiar with. In order to be kind, we have to shut down that animal instinct and force our brain to travel a different pathway. Empathy and compassion are evolved states of being. They require the mental capacity to step past our most primal urges. This may be a surprising assessment because somewhere along the way in the last few years, our society has come to believe that weaponized cruelty is part of some well-thought out master plan. Cruelty is seen by some as an adroit cudgel to gain power. Empathy and kindness are considered weak. Many important people look at the vulnerable only as rungs on a ladder to the top. I'm here to tell you that when someone's path through this world is marked with acts of cruelty, they have failed the first test of an advanced society. They never forced their animal brain to evolve past its first instinct. They never forged new mental pathways to overcome their own instinctual fears. And so their thinking and problem solving will lack the imagination and creativity that the kindest people have in spades. Over my many years in politics and business, I have found one thing to be universally true. The kindest person in the room is often the smartest. i wonder what torokunai2 would have thought about this... Can Trump Arbitrarily Take Money From Anyone's Bank Account?

This story is about the truly electrifying and terrifying question: Can the Trump administration arbitrarily take money from anyone for any reason using control of the payments system? If it can’t, what exactly are the current limits to what the Trump administration can do and how easy is it to break those limits? [...] There is nothing in payments law that provides a clear or unambiguous check on the Trump administration’s actions if they decide to weaponize the federal government’s legal authority over the ACH system... It is hard to explain how explosive degrading — let alone destroying — the legal reliability of payment finality is. Mark Flood, a research scholar at the Center for Financial Policy at University of Maryland with two decades of financial regulatory & policy experience in Federal Government tells me: “Uncertainty about payment finality has the potential to degrade insidiously the performance of the financial system. If there is generally a non-zero chance that even settled payments might be reversed, then the most liquid of assets (cash balances) could lose reliability and therefore value: $1 of ‘cash in the bank’ may no longer be regarded as worth $1.” could this (https://archive.ph/QUtNn) be really stupid (https://archive.ph/e4vum) or crazy smart (https://archive.ph/FsU23) ? which is (https://www.metafilter.com/207699/Getting-to-Denmark-looks-further-away-than-ever-vs-annexing-Greenland) ... The Problem With $TRUMP (https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/the-problem-with-trump/ar-AA1y3omE) - ""Who knows if the president intended this outcome, but leaders in the crypto space have long hoped for the replacement of nation-states with 'network states' encompassing communities that come together on the blockchain. They are celebrating $TRUMP as the first crypto community to have gained control of a nation-state's powers by capturing the president's attention through control of his digital wallet. If what Trump has done is upheld as legal or becomes a norm, other global leaders have every incentive to do what he did, turning democratic governance into corporate governance.""[ 1 (https://www.metafilter.com/207699/Getting-to-Denmark-looks-further-away-than-ever-vs-annexing-Greenland) , 2 (https://www.metafilter.com/188126/A-blind-and-opaque-reputelligent-nosedive) ] and just to put a fine point (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obnlvWC_7mg#t=7m11s) on choosing your allies carefully (https://www.metafilter.com/207849/Youre-either-going-to-make-a-deal-or-were-out#8694043) when it comes to ' you and what army (https://www.metafilter.com/207839/A-revolutionarys-revolution) '...

It's happened quite a bit enough to the point where you could consider it to be policy if troops are retreating. So, these people as a policy will eat their own. So they will not hesitate to eat an American president or American vice president. They don't care what we think. They're not our allies, and they never will be, not at least for a generation. [...] There's also the element of how it will affect the United States long term. Right? So if you're just more transactional in nature and you are concerned: What is the benefit for the United States? I don't think there's any scenario where if this war pauses and sanctions are lifted -- Russia has spent the last three years beefing up their military industrial complex --and if you lift those sanctions, you're going to see a massive influx of funds into that military industrial complex. They're going to build a war machine out of it. Right. That's what they're going to do. And the concept of an imperial and imperialistic, aggressive, modernized military Russia, who has learned their lessons about modern combat is problematic for our future. And if the Russians are given significant concessions in the cease fire, they will spin that as a victory of sorts. But their view is they're not done. So to them, it's just a chance to regroup, build up and modernize, and they'll come back. And when they do come back, they'll be more of a problem than they are now. Right now, they're at the weakest they will ever be. As soon as the cease fire starts, they will immediately start to get stronger and continue to get stronger every day thereafter. So, the way this ends is important, you know, in that context, obviously. also btw... - Compromising with Putin — Sarah Paine (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LfinV4g9mGw) - Is Trump making Putin's dream come true?

People wanted to believe that a government shutdown was a powerful tool -- hell, for a while, I wanted to believe it -- but having seen the GOP play that card over and over again for the past few decades, my biggest takeaways are that it is fundamentally a tool of destruction, and that it has never, ever worked out the way the GOP has hoped it would. It has backfired on them every damn time. And it would have backfired on the Dems too. In this case, I suspect it would probably have put the Dems on an equal footing with the GOP in the eyes of much of the public, i.e, as wreckers of government. That is not a brand the Democratic Party should adopt, IMHO, especially now. I've now been persuaded of this, and that maybe they chose the path that was just slightly less bad. Time will tell... But the above also contains, for me, an argument in favour of not passing the CR: it's time to just wreck stuff, to try to catalyse more substantial change. I think it's naive to think that the Democratic party can and will lead America out of this crisis.  Putting all your hope and support into the Democrats just perpetuates the divide; Americans must instead wake up to the fact that neither party alone has the answer. Things will only change when a majority of Americans both Democrats and Republicans find common cause against the fascists and oligarchs",1 favorite,['/favorited/2/8700030'],2025-03-16 07:00:00,Sunday

This implies those who are directly impacted are the best informed and will make optimal decisions with that information. I can see why that appears to be a sensible conclusion. In practice, I have seen that work in the opposite direction too many times. We've all seen this at election time. I agree Democratic Senators had two bad options to choose from. I agree they messaged it and strategized poorly for weeks if not months (or longer). I value the national conversations folks like Senator Sanders and Representative Ocasio-Cortez are engaging in and wish to see more of this from more elected officials! And I don't see how shutting down the government doesn't play into Republican's hands. Again, no good options.

I'll admit that put me off but the latter half of the video is also confused and confusing. If she's usually good, this is more disappointing.

I’ve put that question to a range of budget experts and shutdown veterans in the past few days, and Democratic lawmakers might want to consider their answers before pulling the trigger.

The much-lauded power of social media to help enact change, as proclaimed by US-based free speech advocates – has been a fail every single time. The few cases of a democratic revolution that did succeed in recent decades, would have just as well succeeded offline. And this was very much the case. What matters is not what people do online, but what they do on the streets. What is social media? It’s a tool, owned almost entirely by American billionaires to push their anti-democratic agenda. Destroy the EU. Destroy public institutions. Divide people. Push hate posts. Push nazism. It’s designed to promote dictatorship, whether Trump or Putin or their lackeys — and to destroy the reputation of respectable individuals and countries who stand in the way. Social media is, as engineered by cryptobros like Musk or Zuckerberg, absolute garbage. Most of the democratic world that do not have a culture of US-style corporatist free speech has gone along with it for far too long. Whatever bright moments US social media once had in the past, have been vaporized. The FPP criticizes banning TikTok. Sure, if the standard is as low as Facebook or X, TikTok may seem like a valid alternative. But we must have higher standards, and we — I speak not as an American but as a European — need to rid ourselves of the US monopoly on social media. Decades ago, it was widely recognized that it is dangerous to allow a foreign country full ownership of media like television or news. The same thinking needs to apply to social media. US social media is a distorting force and not in a good way. RT was banned already. Now ban X, ban Facebook, ban TikTok",19 favorites,['/favorited/2/8696366'],2025-03-06 01:34:00,Thursday

Two sources familiar with its contents say Öcalan praised the governance model in Rojava before offering strategic advice. First, he urged the SDF to establish itself as a legitimate political force within Syria—meaning institutionalizing as a political party and becoming a recognized stakeholder in the country’s governance. Second, he warned that demanding an independent military force in negotiations with Damascus was neither realistic nor necessary, especially if the SDF secured a strong political foothold. To drive the point home, Öcalan pointed to Hezbollah. His message was clear: failing to merge into formal politics at the right moment carries serious risks. Hezbollah, he suggested, had miscalculated at critical junctures, setting itself on a path to decline. The SDF, he implied, should avoid that fate at all costs",0,['https://ezgibasaran.substack.com/p/ocalans-message-to-syrian-kurds'],2025-03-06 10:05:00,Thursday

It just means the layers between input and output.  They're ""hidden"" because they're not the parts you see and interact with directly, but they're not covering up some eldritch evil or anything. But let's be real, bureaucracy has hidden layers too.  Our every interaction with the government hints at a machinery we can never see or touch.

In fact, what they are proposing is the ideology that historian Jeffrey Herf called “reactionary modernism,” which he saw emerging from the Weimar period: “They called for a revolution from the Right that would restore the primacy of politics and the state over economics and the market, and thereby restore the ties between romanticism and rearmament in Germany.” There is almost nothing in the reactionary modernist program that can’t be found in Karp and Zamiska. The nostalgia for lost national greatness, the disdain for markets and effete consumerism in favor of state direction and industrial production, the romantic fixation on technologically advanced armaments, the near-deification of the engineer as the spiritual leadership class of this dark Utopia — it’s all there.

Exactly as intended. Democrats—and whatever remains of the ""never-Trump rump""—should feel free to deploy the same language against the right, that the right regularly deploys against them, and if called out for their indecency and lack of decorum, should point out that nothing is being dealt that's not also being regularly received.

https://www.metafilter.com/207763/Federal-prosecutor-threatens-California-congressman-for-criticizing-Elon,kliuless,https://www.metafilter.com/user/3217,"Letters from an American, February 22, 2025 (https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/february-22-2025) - ""Trump has purged the country's military leadership.""[ 1 (https://www.metafilter.com/207394/The-blast-radius-of-this-terrible-decision-is-virtually-limitless#8679641) ] The purge of military leaders wasn’t the only news last night. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated he intends to fire the judge advocates general, or JAGs—the military lawyers who administer the military code of justice—for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. “Among many other things it’s the military lawyers who determine what is a legal order and what’s not,” Talking Points Memo ’s Marshall pointed out.[ 2 (https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/ominous-3) ] “If you’re planning to give illegal orders they are an obvious obstacle.” “Now that Trump has captured the intelligence services, the Justice Department, and the FBI,” military specialist Tom Nichols wrote in The Atlantic , “the military is the last piece he needs to establish the foundations for authoritarian control of the U.S. government.”[ 3 (https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/a-friday-night-massacre-at-the-pentagon/ar-AA1zyfCg) ] [...] Hegseth refused to say he would abide by the Geneva Conventions. He refused to condemn torture. This idea that modern warfare requires torture shines a harsh light on Trump’s January 29 order to the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security to prepare a 30,000-bed detention facility at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to detain migrants Trump called ""the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people.” Rather than simply deporting them, he said, “Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back, so we're going to send them out to Guantanamo.” Now it appears the White House is moving even beyond turning the military into cowboys with unlimited powers. On Thursday the White House posted on X a 40-second video that purported to be of migrants, in shackles and chains, faceless as the chains clank, with the caption “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight.” As Andrew Egger explained in The Bulwark , ASMR videos use audio cues to create feelings of relaxation and euphoria, or “tingles.”[ 4 (https://www.thebulwark.com/p/the-cruelty-isnt-the-point-its-the) ] No longer is the cruelty of utter domination a necessity for safety, it appears. Now it is a form of sensual pleasure for its own sake. As Jeff Sharlet wrote in Scenes from a Slow Civil War : “ Listen to this , the White House is saying. This will make you feel good. ”[ 5 (https://slowcivilwar.substack.com/p/tingles) ] It is, he points out, “a bondage video” in which “[t]he sound of other people’s pain is the intended pleasure.”[ 6 (https://www.metafilter.com/206296/And-ya-know-getting-them-out-will-be-a-bloody-story#8650946) ] Elon Musk posted over the video: “Haha wow,” with an emoji of a troll and a gold medal. While MAGA seems to have turned an American icon into the basis for a fascist fantasy, President Theodore Roosevelt, who took office in 1901 after the assassination of President William McKinley, had actually worked as a cowboy and deliberately applied what he believed to be the values of the American West to the country as a whole. He insisted that all Americans must have a “Square Deal”—the equal protection of the laws—that the government must clean up the cities, protect the environment, provide education and healthcare, and stop the wealthy from controlling the government. And, when Roosevelt learned that American soldiers had engaged in torture in the Philippines, he deplored those acts.[ 7 (https://www.metafilter.com/204183/Thanks#8576001) ] He promised that “determined and unswerving effort” was “being made, to find out every instance of barbarity on the part of our troops, to punish those guilty of it, and to take, if possible, even stronger measures than have already been taken to minimize or prevent the occurrence of all such acts in the future.”",10 favorites,"['https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/february-22-2025', 'https://www.metafilter.com/207394/The-blast-radius-of-this-terrible-decision-is-virtually-limitless#8679641', 'https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/ominous-3', 'https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/a-friday-night-massacre-at-the-pentagon/ar-AA1zyfCg', 'https://www.thebulwark.com/p/the-cruelty-isnt-the-point-its-the', 'https://slowcivilwar.substack.com/p/tingles', 'https://www.metafilter.com/206296/And-ya-know-getting-them-out-will-be-a-bloody-story#8650946', 'https://www.metafilter.com/204183/Thanks#8576001', '/favorited/2/8691071']",2025-02-23 22:10:00,Sunday

They really aren't, though.  The sanctions have never gone after the Russian energy sector, and they are de facto a petro-state.  Both the US and Europe have conspicuously avoided actually hitting Russia where it would really hurt their economy, because doing so would require actual sacrifice by the West. Until very recently, Russian gas still flowed through Ukraine at the behest of Ukraine's allies.  The Russian ""shadow fleet"" of oil tankers still traverses the world's oceans.  The Ukrainians have been prohibited from using Western weapons—the only weapons that could effectively and with precision destroy—on Russian energy infrastructure.  And the banking system still allows cold, hard cash to flow back to Russia in exchange for their oil and gas. The sanctions regime is a farce and always has been.  Ukrainians are literally dying and losing territory in order to keep the heat on in Western Europe, and keep gas cheap in the US.  And the Ukrainians know it. While I suspect that the Zelenskyy government will eventually sign some sort of awful, one-sided mineral-rights deal with Trump, if they are smart—and they certainly have experience dealing with terrible self-interested politico-oligarchs, and probably much nastier ones than Trump at that—they do have some cards to play.  One of those is to threaten go out in a blaze of glory and take as much Russian energy infrastructure as they can with them in the process.  It might not be enough to stop their annihilation at the hands of Putin, but they could almost certainly drive the price of oil and gas through the roof, and that's something Trump probably does care about, insofar as it might adversely affect his political survival and thus his ability to continue to enrich himself. On the other side of the coin, if they sign a deal that appears to give Trump everything that he wants, his wanton cupiditas might overwhelm the geopolitical considerations that caused his predecessors to keep the Ukrainians fighting with soft gloves.  Perhaps they can extract some strategically-useful concessions in the process, like fewer restrictions on HIMARS targets, or a gentlemen's agreement not to look too hard at any Russian tankers that might suddenly start springing catastrophic leaks, or to let their intelligence services start playing hardball against Russian interests globally.  Ukraine has, up until this point, been forced to fight what amounts to a very clean war against an extremely dirty enemy, at risk of alienating their allies.  But if the US doesn't care about those sort of rules anymore, and the Europeans aren't offering the same level of conventional military support, a valid trade for Ukraine might be to stop concerning themselves with them.  The Russian oligarch class has a vast, poorly-defended underbelly of assets around the globe—principally in Africa, and some even in erstwhile Western allies like Egypt—that have been conspicuously free from Ukrainian targeting.  I don't think we actually know what an all-out greyzone war looks like, but it could be what Trump is basically pushing the Ukrainians into",7 favorites,['/favorited/2/8690839'],2025-02-22 23:11:00,Saturday

Inpatient and residential care are extremely expensive, and so if this gets off the ground it will be pitched as a way to “cure” people and prevent repeat inpatient and residential visits, which will be blamed on the failure of psychiatric medication etc. However, those who have not required that kind of care are not on “borrowed time” and will likely not face this threat to their autonomy unless they experience an acute crisis (which can happen to anyone).

Mr Trump has increasingly focused in his current campaign for the White House on rising levels of homelessness in major cities and is taking a characteristically authoritian approach to dealing with them. In a new video, Mr Trump proposes banning camping wherever possible; arresting anyone found sleeping in unsanctioned areas outdoors; and presenting people with a choice: either agree to enter treatment programmes or go to jail. “Violators of these bans will be arrested, but they will be given the option to accept treatment and services if they’re willing to be rehabilitated,” Mr Trump said in a recent video. “Many of them don’t want that. But we’ll give them the option.” ... To combat homelessness, which is driven first and foremost by high housing costs, Mr Trump is proposing opening large “tent cities,” or camps, where homeless people would be forced to live if they did not want to go to jail. “We will then open up large parcels of inexpensive land, bring in doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, and drug rehab specialists and create tent cities where the homeless can be relocated and their problems identified,” Mr Trump said in the video. “But we’ll open up our cities again, make them livable and make them beautiful.” It is unclear as of yet how Mr Trump would fund his plan. The operation of the “tent cities” alone would likely require a vast amount of money, as would the employment of doctors and social workers to work with houseless people. The plan would also likely attract the opposition of civil rights groups over the extent to which it would coerce people into recieving treatment or living in camps. Bans on public camping in US cities largely have not gotten people off the streets, but rather forced people to move away from needed social services",5 favorites,"['https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-homelessness-policy-tent-cities-b2322102.html', '/favorited/2/8690335']",2025-02-21 09:18:00,Friday

Last night on my commute was the episode "" The Reflex (https://www.constantpodcast.com/episodes/season-3-is-here) "", about the birthing clinics in mid-19th century Vienna, where the one staffed by doctors had three times the maternal mortality rate of the one staffed by midwives. Ignaz Semmelweis came along, and found the only difference was the doctors were doing autopsies in the morning before delivering babies. He had them wash their hands after the autopsies, and the mortality rate dropped from 18% to 2%. The thing was, at the time they didn't understand that diseases were even a communicable thing, so there was no theory about WHY the hand washing worked. Just the data showed that it did. The medical community... utterly rejected that hand washing was meaningful, and actually was offended by it. Because doctors of the time were ""upstanding gentlemen"", and suggesting they even needed to wash their hands implied they were unclean, and they were offended. So Semmelweis spent his entire life being mocked and rejected for his work, regardless of what the data said. Because the data conflicted with the existing worldviews of those people. While we're overall better today at listening to data, there are still entirely too many people, especially in positions of power, that are unwilling to listen to anything that conflicts with their world views. In this case, I think that rift is very clear when it comes to things like autism, ADHD, anxiety, and depression. As much progress has been made to recognize these aren't new things, but things that have been around forever, there are still so many people who absolutely believe these not to be medical in nature, but moral failings. ADHD doesn't mean your brain works differently, because that doesn't happen. It just means you're lazy, that you don't work hard enough. You just need the right discipline to fix you. Especially because if we accept that peoples' brains work different, it means there's even more if that most evil of ideas, ""diversity"". Never mind the fact that the same people pushing these ideas also 100% believe that who a person is and what they can accomplish is entirely determined at birth, a cage which everyone is placed into and never allowed to leave, lest they upset the natural hierarchies which are so natural that they must be enforced by every means possible",10 favorites,"['https://www.constantpodcast.com/episodes/season-3-is-here', '/favorited/2/8690363']",2025-02-21 10:28:00,Friday

I mean, this is not yet a civil war. We did one of those, may not have learned as many lessons as we could have, learned a few, survived.

And I've stood under the giant Sequoias. I haven't been to the Grand Canyon yet, but I intend to hike through it this April. North Cascades National Park is my first love! Olympic, Rainier, Glacier, Kings Canyon, Sequoia, Lassen Volcanic, Crater Lake, Bryce Canyon, Death Valley, Everglades, Redwood, US Virgin Islands, Pinnacles. National parks also manage National Monuments, so I should probably include Ebey's Landing as the national park unit I have been to the most by far. The national parks are the only places I've ever been seen rangers looking for my permit or my bear gear while I was in the backcountry.  A Yosemite ranger once gave me a beer and chatted with me for an hour about his park and life and so on while letting me take a break on the porch of his ranger cabin. They really care! It is astonishing. When it comes to ACAB, the law enforcement park rangers I've encountered are the least B of any cop I've seen. The parks are goddamn beautiful, and even though not all parts are accessible to everyone, there are places of astonishing beauty that you can just drive right up to, and millions of people do. Most of the parks on my list were visited after I turned 40, which is pretty typical, I think. You live your whole life without ever needing them, but you can be confident that they will be there when you want them. I feel like even just knowing they were out there gave me joy, so now, every time I have to pay a use fee, I get a little aggrieved feeling that goes ""this should all be payed for by everyone's taxes because even when you aren't visiting, you are using it."" There is already a maintenance backlog in most parks. Visitor numbers are rising. The funding should be doubled, tripled, quadrupled, not cut, and the parks should be free. It is impossible not to notice how many national parks are right next to reservations, and if you aren't a complete dick or maybe even if you are, the locals will point out the obvious fact that the parks are on native lands. But the US is kind of in a hole on that score everywhere, and it seems to me like the preservation mission of the parks was a way to stop digging the hole. Or dig slower. National parks were sometimes willing to consider working with local tribes, even if they aren't going to go landback any time soon. Certainly that's better than putting in uranium mines (https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/uranium-shipments-resume-protected-grand-canyon-areas-after-navajo-nation-energy-fuels-finalize-deal) .

For the better part of the decade or more preceding Trump 2.0 there have been hardcore traditional conservatives ( status quo is morally correct: things are as they are because they should be as they are because they are as they are) who have been against public schools! Why? Because education subverts the status quo: where do the plebeians go once educated? Education only breeds upheaval and hope against the status quo. I used to say “At least we don’t have those crazies at the helm.” Carnegie built libraries to be subversive because he saw the value books gave him. Roosevelt declared national parks were America’s great cathedrals and castles against the privately owned buildings and lands of Europe. Jefferson pinned that an educated electorate necessary to be a free electorate. In the minds of hardcore status quo conservatives anything free for the masses is not something they could make money from, it is more nefarious: community good subverts a world order that otherwise serves only them. I’d love to own a peace of a national park. Set me on the rim of Yosemite Valley, Grand Canyon or Zion. Put me in the waters of Glacier Bay or NW Hawaii! They’re incredible.

And for all four of those decades, concentration of wealth - a measure not of what somebody's income is, but of how much stuff they own - has been sitting there in the background doing the exponential increase thing that any kind of compounding accumulator (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O133ppiVnWY) always does. Wealth concentration also got a literally unimaginable boost once all the COVID handouts had trickled down through the economy to their inevitable destination in the sump of stagnant wealth where the biggest bottom-feeders dwell. Those three rather dry, techical-sounding words - concentration of wealth - mean something. What they mean is that there now exists a very, very small group of people who own almost everything in the world. That, in turn, means that all the people and governments who used to own those things no longer do. Which means that when we need to use those things, we pay some kind of fee or rent for that. This makes everything more expensive for everybody - ordinary people and our governments - with the sole exception of this tiny coterie that owns all of those things we're now paying them to let us use. There is more concentrated wealth now than there has ever been at any time in human history.  The concentration is now so extreme that no income tax increase policy that the general public would find even vaguely acceptable will ever begin to undo it. The only public policy capable of digging us out of this increasingly deep social hole is a yearly tax on assets according to their assessed value as opposed to any capital gains that result from their sale. The behaviour we want our taxation policy to discourage is the hoarding of assets and a progressive taxation rate that increases as the hoard size does is the sensible way to do that. The beauty of assets as an object to be taxed is that they're fixed in place. Threaten to tax a billionaire's income and they just rearrange their affairs such that that income arrives from some other country, or they move themselves and their business somewhere else; this is the threat of ""capital flight"" that leaves governments scared to get serious about tax rates at the top end and has them all convinced that going after the money where it actually is will always be a bit of a pipe dream. But tax a billionaire's portfolio of supermarkets, apartment blocks, hospitals, superyachts, football clubs, company shares, government bonds and massive residential compounds, though, and what can they do about it? They can't move the buildings offshore. They also can't enforce demands for interest payments or dividends on in-country financial instruments they're not willing to disclose that they own. We don't actually care if the billionaire goes offshore, we're taxing assets that we can see regardless of which entitled prick's name is on them. Plus, given that most people are never going to own enough assets to attract any tax under a properly designed progressive scheme - given that concentrated wealth is what we're going after - the absolute number of assets upon which taxes need to be calculated is always going to be way way lower than the number of income streams that already get assessed for income tax purposes. The extra administrative burden of a new assets tax policy would be relatively tiny, especially if income taxes at the poverty end phase out as assets taxes at the billionaire end phase in. The only defence that a billionaire has against a progressive assessed-value assets tax is breaking up their hoard into smaller pieces and using complicated ownership structures to hide the fact that those pieces ultimately have the same owner. But again, this is a practice that's already completely routine when it comes to evading or avoiding progressive income taxes; services like the IRS are already well practised at tracking that stuff down, and because the total number of assets is always going to be lower than the total number of income streams derivable from those assets, the more government revenue we get from assets taxes the easier it will become to detect evasion and avoidance schemes. DEMAND PROGRESSIVE ASSETS TAXES. Demand them loudly, demand them often, demand them in company, get this idea on the table. Because for as long as it stays off the table, entitled assholes will continue to get away with blaming immigrants for everything and keeping the general population at each other's throats with bullshit culture wars, and governments will stay too poor to be able to fund services properly, and the general standard of living will keep on going backwards until we're all living in slums around the walls of our local Neom",57 favorites,"['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O133ppiVnWY', '/favorited/2/8688835']",2025-02-18 02:33:00,Tuesday

First: Denmark has one of the lowest rates of corruption in the world (https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024) , we will pay high taxes because we know no-one is stealing our money. This was established already during the 18th century under absolute monarchy. The famous Danish trust is not about homogeneity (the Danish Kingdom was not homogenous at the time), but about unwavering commitment to the rule of law, which somehow survived the introduction of democracy in 1849, the rise of industrial tycoons during the late 19th century, an attempted coup in 1920, and of course the threat of totalitarianism during the 1930s. Which brings me to the foundation of the welfare state in January 1933. Because of the global economic situation, there was a lot of political unrest in Denmark, with both left and right activists threatening the social order. Under impression of the situation in Germany, our neighbor, the Social Democratic prime minister Stauning invited all the mainstream parties to a negotiation in his private apartment in Kanslergade, Copenhagen, and even though the actual Nazi-curious conservatives dropped out, the rest opted in. Hence the Kanslergade Agreement is an agreement across the aisle, which is very different from the original welfare models in Sweden, Norway and Germany. As a consequence, it was given from the outset that the welfare had to be for everyone. People are often confused at how rich people in Denmark can benefit from the public education, healthcare and pensions along with everyone else. But that is the whole point of the system. Our current PM, Mette Frederiksen, is clearly modeling herself and her coalition government on Stauning and the Kanslergade coalition. Which is funny because she doesn't look a bit like Stauning (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorvald_Stauning#/media/File:Stauning_eller_Kaos.jpg) . But what both Stauning and Frederiksen realized was that a solid centrist coalition will leave the radicals squealing on the fringes, unable to mobilize a dangerous amount of followers. But to get back to the beginning. I don't think strong anti-corruption policies are a guarantee for democracy, (https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024/index/sgp) but I do think they are a prerequisite for a functioning democracy, and the Citizens United decision (https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained) tilted the US in the wrong direction. As a result, the US population has an extremely low rate of trust in government (https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/trust-in-government.html?oecdcontrol-0ad85c6bab-var1=DNK%7CGBR%7CUSA%7CCRI%7CFIN%7CFRA%7CCAN%7CGRC%7CISL%7CMEX%7CKOR%7CJPN) . Before you tax anyone, rich or poor, you have to build trust in government. I think. BTW, during the aughts, we had a mini version of a trumpian dismantling of government with the Anders Fogh Rasmussen (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Fogh_Rasmussen) administrations. He could do this because he allied himself with the far right Dansk Folkeparti breaking the Danish firewall against racism, just like it is being proposed by J.D. Vance for Germany to do now. Obviously, it couldn't be as bad as anything in the US and to some extent we were saved by the EU, but it was bad, and some of the damage done is irreparable. Our tax system has not yet recovered although 15 years have passed",59 favorites,"['https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorvald_Stauning#/media/File:Stauning_eller_Kaos.jpg', 'https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024/index/sgp', 'https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained', 'https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/trust-in-government.html?oecdcontrol-0ad85c6bab-var1=DNK%7CGBR%7CUSA%7CCRI%7CFIN%7CFRA%7CCAN%7CGRC%7CISL%7CMEX%7CKOR%7CJPN', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Fogh_Rasmussen', '/favorited/2/8688844']",2025-02-18 03:54:00,Tuesday

So much of our political issues since the turn of the century (or really, since the 1994 midterms) can be summed up in this. The right has a clear consensus on what they want: patriarchal dictatorship. The rest of us, even though we outnumber them two to one even on a bad day, have nothing like that. Ardent Progressives have a real point in that what the mainstream Dems propose is way too hierarchical/corporate and conservative for most of the rest of us, and that the mainstream Dems know this, but won't/can't do anything about it because they're too beholden to rich donors because they believe they cannot win elections without that money. (edit: and that they would way rather fight the Ardent Progressives than actually do anything about our problems) Ardent Progressives are absolutely blind to the fact that most of the rest of us don't want to go all the way even to Universal Scandinavia, let alone Universal Basic Income, or that while with the right spokespeople/candidates they might be able to persuade a working majority of us that Universal Scandinavia could be a consensus choice, they almost absolutely without fail choose the worst possible spokespeople/candidates and try to lecture the rest of us that we're stupid or evil for not wanting their weird utopia, when in fact most of what we really object to is the spokespeople/candidates. It's a real problem. It's theoretically possible to come up with Universal Scandinavia Sort of Lite, create a pretty clear version of what that is, and come up with a bumper-sticker way of expressing it. But the mainstream Dems are frankly worthless and the only people they're willing to fight to the death are the Ardent Progressives, while the Ardent Progressives are only willing to fight the people immediately to their right. The same kind of internet polarization that splits communities apart because extremists get more clicks happens within the resistance to fascism, as well. It also doesn't help that both groups epically suck at marketing/messaging, while the fascists are somehow really good at it. Nothing here is likely a revelation to most of the people reading it; I'm mostly just working out a thought that's been bouncing around my head for a couple of days. Insofar as something useful can come out of it, maybe it's to get people opposed to fascism thinking about what the consensus alternative can be, instead of just ""no we don't want this"", which may be true, but is also less than effective",16 favorites,['/favorited/2/8688876'],2025-02-18 08:00:00,Tuesday

The only effective counter is messaging that will similarly appeal to toddlers: that those very rich people who aren't suffering at all are bad people because they don't want to share; and that the big man is a bully and is neither your daddy nor your friend, in fact he's a scary man who will hurt you, see how he's hurt all these other people; and that we can all work together to make the greedy people share with everyone.

Consider a thought experiment: Who is the most responsible for the current dire situation in American politics? A. The ultra wealthy ultra right (eg. Koch Bros/Mercers/Federalist Soc/Heritage Foundation) B. Donald Trump, himself, personally, plus Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller C. Right wing tech billionaires (eg. Theil, Zuckerberg, Musk) D. The Roberts Court E. The mainstream media writ large (eg. New York Times, CNN, NBC News) F. Democratic leadership (eg. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, Harris) G. Bernie Sanders, AOC and the very online left (eg. Jacobin) The first issue here is that literally A-E are all variously responsible and working in cooperation, to the effect that even without 1 or 2 of them, we would probably still be in this mess. But the only people that the F. Democratic leadership is willing to go hard against are the people with less power than them: G. Bernie, AOC and the very online left. The second issue is that there is no other concentration of political power in this country that is well positioned to contest the A-E juggernaut. The lack of effective rhetoric with which a political movement might undertake opposition is entirely downstream from the lack of an organized polity that could develop and take up that rhetoric to use as a basis for political opposition. The reason for that lack of organized political power is the establishment Democratic leadership's complete and total abdication of their responsibility to act as a focus and forum for developing that power, or to conversely get out of the way for someone who will do so. Conclusion: The question of who bears the most responsibility for how we got here has no clear resolution because of the complicating factor of the abdication of the opposition. The road out of this jeopardy will similarly have to be found outside of the usual halls of power. The fact that the ownership of the primary means of organizing employed by younger generations is literally owned and operated by one of the antagonists in question raises serious concerns about the bounds of the possible in that arena",13 favorites,['/favorited/2/8688939'],2025-02-18 11:31:00,Tuesday

And out as well - into private accounts tucked away into the balance sheets of massive global banks and small countries willing to take those assets, accounts that no doubt are being held by many of the people who are now acting against the interests of the US and democracies everywhere. This is a global war. We constrain our thinking to the US at our peril. The next great world war has already begun, not just the proxy hot wars but a war of minds globally.

But Russia is spending. Why are they so invested? Speaking of Russia alone, there are hard realities they need to face and deal with in the ensuing decades: -Climate change legislation would kill their revenues from oil and mineral production, which has continued since 2003 to increase as a % against all other income streams as other industries fall further behind -Warming temperatures open up alternative land masses in the Arctic they can claim for themselves with additional resources. More warming is good for Russia. -Climate change - based on the best estimates - will introduce massive global food insecurity by the 2030s as temperature changes, drought, flooding, crop diseases and migrations affect global and regional food availability (hence the invasion of Ukraine, the source of so much wheat, sunflowers, barley and more). Control of this production will be a major source of soft power for Russia. Interesting USAID is killed immediately in the current ongoing coup, setting aside the Elon related theories about its role in ending apartheid or investigating Starlink. Russia wants the global community starving for food so they can provide. -Population cliffs - They will need more people.

The secret sauce is the fact that this is just the endpoint (?) of a transformation that began, depending on who you ask, as far back as the 1940s. Certainly the transformation of the Republican party into an illiberal party was already underway in the 1990s with the rise of Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh, and Fox News. The Republican old guard had to pander to the growing illiberal base, but they were still firmly in charge until the rise of the Tea Party in 2007 (although even the Tea Party was not nearly as illiberal as MAGA is now). Even then, the old guard still controlled the most important levers of power until 2016. The years from 2016 until 2023 or 2024 were the final power struggle, which the illiberal faction has now won completely.

A. The ultra wealthy ultra right .. Heritage Foundation) B.. The Heritage Foundation should not be treated as another secular think tank, they are driven by the theology of The New Apostolic Reformation NAR - a global Dominionist movement dead set on taking the whole planet (for their image of) God. The NAR were and are very heavily influenced by the the theology of John Rushdoony (1916-2001), his Institutes of Biblical Law 1973 (funny how US Christians are so offended by Sharia when you see this title), imagined Christian Dominion of all the Earth occurring naturally and gradually over centuries.  The Institutes was the framework for Christian reconstructionism (https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/41330/chapter/352334811) [Oxford Handbook Topics in Religion]. US political Christians of the early 1980's saw the Institutes as an opportunity to accelerate the future into the present. As part of this they deliberately set out to attract potential political leaders (and policy people) - and to convert those already in. The Seven Mountains Mandate is a later development of this (the Seven Mountains are family , religion , education , media , arts and entertainment , business , and government . Note omission of science and environment/planet). This latter is probably due to their attitude to Earth: For God so loved His disposable planet (https://www.metafilter.com/207705/O-beautiful-for-spacious-skies#8689077) .. my comment on another thread yesterday. What the US political apparatus represents now is a group aligned around the idea of themselves taking the planet for God (after they have remade God in their own political image).

In any case, ENO don't have the money to commission anything, although they would have been the natural home of a new British opera.  And WNO have just had their government funding yanked too. Otherwise, the smart thing to do would be for WNO, maybe jointly with Scottish, immediately to commission a new opera about the miners' strike.  Maybe an oratorio would be possible, given the budget constraints?  Put the chorus at the centre of the action, weave in traditional music and union songs, and have Thatcher being smug and patronising about everything.  Really it's about solidarity vs. individualism.  Maybe have Thatcher's ""There's no such thing as society"" speech as her final triumphant aria, before the last chorus which speaks directly to the audience. Because this : He said Mrs T would “not be a didactic piece” or have a political message, adding: “What we are hoping is that people who are great supporters and people who are fierce critics and lots of people who have no opinion whatsoever will enjoy this work.” this is some bullshit.

This is a particularly important point: Nearly everyone involved in the fight to cancel DRIPA is a realtor, a yacht owner, or both. To advance their interests, they’re working hard to stoke the flames of centuries-old racial tensions on the Sunshine Coast. They want us to believe they’re the good guys, standing up against Indigenous rights on behalf of all Canadians. Because, as long as we’re worked up about Indigenous people coming after our rights, we won’t notice that it’s the yachting class who are taking them away. That it’s their oversized docks blocking our access to public land, their obsession with property values fueling our housing crisis, their yachts guzzling gas and polluting our water, and their excessive wealth going toward a hateful lawsuit rather than literally anything else. And besides the yacht owners and realtors, one of the lawyers who filed the petition focuses on representing mining, energy, forestry interests specially in relation to Indigenous consultation (i.e. resisting and avoiding it's effects). The petition is seeking to deny the ability for the government to grant any meaningful decision making authority to Indigenous people.

https://www.metafilter.com/207449/Ceasefire-isnt-the-end-to-genocide,sotonohito,https://www.metafilter.com/user/17651,"Whether he intended to or not, what Trump is doing is shifting the Overton window. Previously, at least outside Israel, it was taboo to openly talk about the complete elimination of Palestinians from Gaza even via deportation rather than murder. Now it's in the space of things that can be spoken of. And sure, slime like Graham are going to talk cautiously about it, but if Trump starts doing it we all know Graham and his ilk will fall in line. No Republican is going to vote against Dear Leader Trump's plan to advance Christian theological goals by helping Israel expand to it's Biblical borders and thus (for a LOT of American Christians) finally force Jesus to stop dicking around and start ending the world so they can avoid death and get superhero bodies in Heaven. Never forget that for a huge number of Americans this isn't about Israel as a country. It's about the preconditions for the end of the world (which they consider to be a good thing). To them Jews don't really exist as people, Jews are background characters, or pawns/tokens/pieces, that have to be put into an Israel at its Biblical borders so they can rebuild the temple which will then allow/force Jesus to destory Israel and kill all the Jews as act one of the end of the world. Any plan that gets all the Palestinians out of Gaza is a plan that Trump's Christian fundamentalist voters will wholeheartedly endorse. They are dead serious, to them this Scofield end of the world stuff is as real as gravity (moreso really), and they are often desperate to get to the end of the world before they die. That last is also criticial. They don't just think the world will end someday and they'll be reunited with their loved ones after death. They believe that if the world ends soon enough they not only will never die but all their other problems will be solved. Their bodies will be replaced by immortal supermodel/superhero versions of themselves, they'll live as billionaires in heaven and not have to worry about money or work again, and while they don't speak about it too much openly there's also the undercurrent that any mental issues they have will also be magicked away by Jesus while they live as supermodel billionaires basking in the glory of God and (to repeat) will not die. and all of that is dependent on getting all the Palestinians out of Israel (or at least totally subjugated) so that all the Jews on Earth can be forced to live in Israel so they can all be killed by Jesus. On the less theological level, there's a lot of people (including sadly far too many on the liberal and left) who just want to stop hearing about the conflict and long for the silence of negative peace that is Palestinians just STFUing and never being heard from again. The only real impediment to Trump getting enthusiastic bipartisan support for his proposal is the threat of US soldiers being involved and the war costing America lives and treasure. If that can be outsourced and Israel pays the price then we've already seen that the majority of Democrats (both elected and not) are totally fine with it.

But resisting fascism is our collective goal. We just know that in order to resist it, we have to fight it on two fronts of U.S. state violence: at home and abroad. Because if the United States, together with Israel, manages to disembowel the ICJ, the ICC, the UN, and a broader global order built after the Holocaust and World War II, no one is safe. The fact that Israel has committed genocide, turned humans into walking bombs in its pager attack in Lebanon, and decimated countries while the UN Security Council watches passively should concern all of us.

What is more likely in my estimation is the West Bank being in line for decimation (unlike the Biden administration where people who could slow walk in bureaucratese are probably themselves on the chopping block for Heritage and Elon reasons instead), with no immediate condos in Gaza + to the utter eventual dismay of the Israelis the de facto occupation of Gaza being administered instead by direct American proxies. If there is going to be American civilian action it won't be on Palestine, but rather on the more numerous and directly visible to the domestic audience tyre fires that are happening right now - so I support the strike idea -- simply because the break and distrust caused by liberals burning their political currency on Israel to put down the protestor energy that could have been mobilized now.

Speaking of that: - Recall this Sept 2024 piece (for those who can't see Palestinians except as a nuisance): Ex-hostage’s mother denies IDF told her he was killed in Gaza airstrike -
Military denies report alleging army chief hid details of deaths of hostages whose bodies were recovered in December; Ron Sherman’s mother says her family had no official word (https://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-hostages-mother-denies-idf-told-her-he-was-killed-in-gaza-airstrike/amp/?__cf_chl_tk=GibVoMRPKdpfvwaEx.y.68sDTMoKxm8llHIGv2Nx7dw-1739074393-1.0.1.1-YqdSMX9U1oFw8iMASsDuIMfKTzsct8u_ziXuqIGcngo) She said that, according to the unofficial information the family had heard, the three likely died of carbon dioxide poisoning due to lack of oxygen in the tunnel following the strike. The IDF said in January, when it presented findings to the families, that it could neither confirm nor deny that the hostages may have suffocated or been poisoned, or died due to any other cause indirectly related to an IDF attack or Hamas action. Toxicology tests, which could shed light on their cause of death, had yet to be completed at the time. - now here's this new +972 piece: Bomb the area, gas the tunnels: Israel’s unbridled war on Gaza’s underground -
Unable to pinpoint Hamas commanders in Gaza’s tunnels, the Israeli army decimated entire residential blocks with bunker-buster bombs to crush the passages below and flood them with lethal fumes, an investigation reveals. (https://www.972mag.com/tunnels-hamas-lethal-gas-bombs-gaza/) So the stupid army can't find anybody and repeats the same sin of gassing everybody. Good job. Unless of course, they're not being stupid, that's just the plan. Can't say that's not without merit, as shared above with the Yoav Gallant interview, not only the same ceasefire terms that's returned those precious emaciated hostages has been on the table for months, rejected by Israel not Hamas, the Hannibal Directive was also implemented though unevenly. A country has no right to exist; people do - and Israel violates that for everyone so what's the point of defending an action of such a nation? ---- Pair these: (A Saudi-linked platform) Palestinian statehood is the answer, nothing else (https://www.arabnews.com/node/2589387) (Mouin Rabbani writing for New Arab) Is Trump's Gaza 'takeover' actually Jared Kushner's last hurrah? -
Trump isn’t the first to propose the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Even if his plan fails, it still reinforces Israel's genocidal designs (https://www.newarab.com/opinion/trumps-gaza-takeover-actually-jared-kushners-last-hurrah) Secondly, Washington’s closest Arab allies have once again rejected the proposal out of hand, only this time more forcefully and more publicly than with Blinken in 2023. The Saudi foreign ministry, apparently alarmed and incensed in equal measure by Trump’s additional claim that Riyadh is not making Palestinian statehood a condition for normalisation with Israel, went so far as to put out a press release at 4:30 in the morning to make its position unambiguously clear. Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, and even the United Arab Emirates issued similar public declarations. Yet clearly, the public rebuke from Saudi Arabia was pivotal in bringing Trump back to earth (...) As others have noted, Trump’s proposals regarding Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal may be equally harebrained but in contrast to the Gaza Riviera scheme are at least identifiably connected to US interests. The challenge now is to impress upon Washington that its interests are better served by compelling Israel to fulfil its commitments under the ceasefire agreements it was forced to accept, rather than indulge its genocidal fantasies I've seen Iyad el-Baghdadi say similar and with some more elaboration but I'll quote Murtaza Hussain (https://xcancel.com/MazMHussain/status/1888281999124615621?s=19) 's twt as it's more succinct: Saudi state-connected news outlets are pretty much unanimous that a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for ties with Israel. There is none of the ground-preparing that we saw in years past. The original impetus for the Abraham Accords was fear of Iran among the GCC states. Ironically, because of both Israeli actions and their own talks with Iran, that fear has dissipated significantly of late. There is thus no strong pressure to take the risk of normalizing ties with Israel any longer outside of the old 1967-lines framework. The Iran-backed Axis of Resistance is being replaced with Sunni Islamist regimes backed by Qatar, Turkey and potentially Saudi Arabia in future. This is probably less optimal for Israel as these countries are wealthier and less isolated than Iran and its allies, all of whom operated in militia-ruled and dysfunctional states that were not meaningfully threatening. (The fact that Israel openly parades its connections to Putin's Russia with no blowback from the USA, I'm entertained by the notion that American consensus-manufacturing energy will be launched on yet another fool's errand when inevitably Israel pivots to a friendship with Iran out of their typical expansionist derangement, being surrounded by ""Sunni foes"". I'm sure when that happens I can expect serious-sounding warnings about the Chinese influence campaign. Or Russia, of course.)",7 favorites,"['https://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-hostages-mother-denies-idf-told-her-he-was-killed-in-gaza-airstrike/amp/?__cf_chl_tk=GibVoMRPKdpfvwaEx.y.68sDTMoKxm8llHIGv2Nx7dw-1739074393-1.0.1.1-YqdSMX9U1oFw8iMASsDuIMfKTzsct8u_ziXuqIGcngo', 'https://www.972mag.com/tunnels-hamas-lethal-gas-bombs-gaza/', 'https://www.arabnews.com/node/2589387', 'https://www.newarab.com/opinion/trumps-gaza-takeover-actually-jared-kushners-last-hurrah', 'https://xcancel.com/MazMHussain/status/1888281999124615621?s=19', '/favorited/2/8685228']",2025-02-08 20:20:00,Saturday

Even The New York Times’ made the very novel discovery of what international law may have to say about forced displacement. What we are seeing, again and again, is the introduction of language that not only offers the criminality of a Trump administration policy that has yet to be put in place but also explicitly moralizes about violence against Palestinians, a moralizing that was markedly absent as U.S-funded and made bombs were ripping apart Palestinian families for fifteen months straight. CNN’s senior reporter Stephen Collinson, who covers the White House, called Trump’s “outlandish” and “mind-boggling” plan “the most stunning U.S. intervention in the long history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict”. Compare Collinson’s opening paragraphs from this recent analysis to the opening paragraphs from his September 2024 analysis of the Biden administration’s failure to secure a ceasefire. (...) This urgency, this moralizing – the lack of hesitation to push back – isn’t unique to news coverage. Late Night host Seth Meyers, who offered a tepid critique of Biden’s refusal to push for a ceasefire in April 2024, has dedicated several “Closer Look” segments of his show over the last ten days to the Trump administration and Gaza. Meyers not only called Trump’s proposal “abhorrent and unhinged” but also explicitly stated that it would be a “massive human rights violation that constitutes ethnic cleansing and violates international law” and would “cause outrage around the world and entangle the US in exactly the kind of foreign quagmire [Trump] promised to keep us out of.” In the same segment, Meyers offers another tepid critique of Biden – saying it should have never gotten to this point and that Biden should have pushed for a ceasefire. Absent is the moralizing language of condemnation and the indictment of violating international law and plunging the Middle East into a complete U.S.-led crisis. Biden, once again, is presented as simply insufficient and disappointing versus a President who was fully and actively overseeing the extermination of an entire nation",6 favorites,"['https://mondoweiss.net/2025/02/the-liberal-establishment-is-finally-criticizing-ethnic-cleansing-in-gaza-now-that-they-can-blame-trump/', '/favorited/2/8688843']",2025-02-18 03:36:00,Tuesday

The war dragged on for a year with great suffering in Gaza and hostages continuing to die,” Goldenberg wrote. “The disagreements between Netanyahu and Biden surfaced piecemeal and incoherently, with Netanyahu using every opportunity to create distance between himself and Biden, and weaken Biden’s standing with the Israeli public eventually eroding his leverage,” he added. The reflection offered a different take on the Biden administration’s handling of the war after former White House Middle East czar Brett McGurk presented an unapologetic defense of the former president’s policy in a Washington Post op-ed last week.

All we need from liberals is for them to oppose the right, and whether or not they do that is going to be determined by national-scale historical and political factors, not by petty interpersonal dynamics. What I think this sorta misses is that it's worth distinguishing when the disagreement is over a goal/desired outcome, and over tactics. What is counterproductive is name-calling someone who shares your goal(s), but simply differs on how they think is best to get there. This is certainly more likely to happen in online spaces - it is certainly far easier to call someone ""spineless"" than try to have a conversation of why they think their tactic is better, and what concerns they have about your tactic. And with regard to tactics, I think it's good to keep an openness to the fact that nobody really ever knows the precise best tactic, because nobody can predict the future. The author focuses on politicians - and yeah, professional politicians generally (well, historically) operate less on pettiness and more on political expediency for their broad goals.

You understand something about this space I don't, and if you think I'm setting myself up for failure you should say so. That's being a good ally."" Allyship, at least how it was taught to me, is about providing access to your power and privilege.

(There were also extenuating factors - including some health issues I've been experiencing which led to me being repeatedly guilt-tripped and/or yelled at for not showing up to meetings. I got called ""passive aggressive"" for waiting a week to raise some concerns in person at a meeting rather than calling a member of the group directly while I was literally in the hospital. In general, there was definitely not a practice of ""respectfully disagreeing with another person's political perspective or opinions about strategies and tactics"" and instead a lot of ""immediately call people out based on some aspect of their identity/privilege when you disagree with them""). When I eventually couldn't take it anymore, I stepped down from my leadership role in the group, which was met with an epic, 2-hour guilt trip along the lines of the tone of this article (i.e. ""toughen up and put the movement ahead of your own feelings/health issues""). I have... a lot of conflicted feelings about the ""left"" these days which are obviously heavily tied up in my experiences with this particular group, but it has been a sad and lonely time to be without a ""political home."" The comments in this post/thread have been really validating - so thank you all! One thing that I think the author of this piece misses a bit is that not all socialist groups operate in the same way. He's basically advocating that, no matter how dysfunctional a socialist organization may be, you should keep showing up even if you don't ""like it,"" and I'm not sure I agree with this. I think we can all stand to toughen up a little bit, but it's also worthwhile to push our organizations on the left to function better. In my own situation, I have been exploring and looking for other groups that are functioning better (meaning, there are some basic structures in place to keep the group on task and focused on strategy, and there's clear and intentional leadership - I find the ""decentralized leadership"" bs to basically be an excuse for the de facto leaders to avoid taking any accountability when there's conflict within the group).

Obviously this is not Spain in the 1930s but coincidentally I was reading Orwell last night and found the echoes in this and Spilling The Spanish Beans (https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/spilling-the-spanish-beans-2/) interesting: The peasant and the worker hate feudalism and clericalism; but so does the “liberal” bourgeois, who is not in the least opposed to a more modern version of Fascism, at least so long as it isn’t called Fascism. The “liberal” bourgeois is genuinely liberal up to the point where his own interests stop [...] For clearly he has no chance to develop in a feudal society where the worker and the peasant are too poor to buy goods... Hence, in the face of such a blatant reactionary as Franco, you get for a while a situation in which the worker and the bourgeois, in reality deadly enemies, are fighting side by side. This uneasy alliance is known as the Popular Front (or, in the Communist Press, to give it a spuriously democratic appeal, People’s Front). It is a combination with about as much vitality, and about as much right to exist, as a pig with two heads or some other Barnum and Bailey monstrosity. In any serious emergency the contradiction implied in the Popular Front is bound to make itself felt. For even when the worker and the bourgeois are both fighting against Fascism, they are not fighting for the same things; the bourgeois is fighting for bourgeois democracy, i.e., capitalism, the worker, in so far as he understands the issue, for Socialism... [T]he real struggle in Spain, on the Government side, has been between revolution and counter-revolution; that the Government, though anxious enough to avoid being beaten by Franco, has been even more anxious to undo the revolutionary changes with which the outbreak of war was accompanied. Any Communist would reject this suggestion as mistaken or wilfully dishonest. He would tell you that it is nonsense to talk of the Spanish Government crushing the revolution, because the revolution never happened; and that our job at present is to defeat Fascism and defend democracy. And in this connection it is most important to see just how the Communist anti-revolutionary propaganda works. [...] Broadly speaking, Communist propaganda depends upon terrifying people with the (quite real) horrors of Fascism. It also involves pretending – not in so many words, but by implication – that Fascism has nothing to do with capitalism. Fascism is just a kind of meaningless wickedness, an aberration, “mass sadism,” the sort of thing that would happen if you suddenly let loose an asylum-ful of homicidal maniacs. Present Fascism in this form, and you can mobilise public opinion against it, at any rate for a while, without provoking any revolutionary movement. You can oppose Fascism by bourgeois “democracy,” meaning capitalism. But meanwhile you have got to get rid of the troublesome person who points out that Fascism and bourgeois ‘democracy’ are Tweedledum and Tweedledee. You do it at the beginning by calling him an impracticable visionary. You tell him that he is confusing the issue, that he is splitting the anti-Fascist forces, that this is not the moment for revolutionary phrase-mongering, that for the moment we have got to fight against Fascism without inquiring too closely what we are fighting for. Later, if he still refuses to shut up, you change your tune and call him a traitor..",16 favorites,"['https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/spilling-the-spanish-beans-2/', '/favorited/2/8680531']",2025-01-30 11:58:00,Thursday

The Extreme Right is well-organized, well-funded, disciplined, and has an agenda they are pretty successfully ramming down our throats.  The Right controls the narrative.  People believe at least 2/3 of their message, much of which is wildly false; the rest is mostly false.  Truth and facts are absolutely degraded. Abortion, Immigration, and Trans/Queer Rights are distractions to keep people from noticing the Fascism.  And the money grab.  Occupy Wall Street was pretty awesome, but C level salaries are higher than ever, the wealthiest are wealthier, the homeless are more numerous, personal debt is at an all time high.

Work together on Medicare expansion, improving the child tax credit, building public transportation, what have you. Pick an actual thing you want to happen in the world and make it happen. There is one overarching issue that has been making all of those goals recede over the horizon ever faster for the last forty years, and that's the unconstrained increase in wealth inequality brought on by laissez-faire economics having won the public policy debate in the mid 80s. Wealth inequality now exists at a level not seen since feudal times or arguably ever. The reason the cost of living is so high now is that ordinary people are asset-poor, and the reason that governments struggle to do anything about that is that privatization has been fashionable for long enough that governments are now asset-poor. The only group remaining who are not vastly more asset-poor than they were before the Thatcher/Reagan/Friedman hostile takeover is a relatively tiny group of obscenely wealthy families whose income is entirely passive - these people don't get paid for contributing to the world, merely for owning it. The only way that the lives of ordinary people are ever going to improve is if asset ownership can be broadened, so that it once again becomes realistic for ordinary people to aspire to formerly ordinary goals like owning a home or having work that pays well enough to fund that. The only sustainable way to broaden asset ownership is by implementing taxation policy that acts as a disincentive to concentration and hoarding. This requires building an appropriate level of assets taxes into the system so that the deck becomes stacked less absurdly heavily in favour of the biggest private players. It ain't the immigrants, it's the inequality. The only voices within the Democratic Party who have been putting this essentially irrefutable case over the last twenty years have been on its left flank. Sanders and Warren have been on about this since approximately forever, but despite both of them being quite skilled at making an argument without calling anybody (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin) a useless lying pandering two-faced self-serving sack of shit, Party leadership has been absolutely consistent in ignoring and marginalizing their voices and seeking to exclude new talent that might potentially support them internally. The Squad exists despite the best efforts of the DNC, not because of them. If the Democratic Party is even slightly serious about becoming seen as something other than TweedleD then it needs to distinguish itself clearly from TweedleDumb by addressing the single biggest issue underpinning pretty much all of today's public immiseration. If instead it continues to shrink away from any proposal that reads even vaguely leftist as if it were a slug tasting salt, it's going to take longer for the rubes to see through fascism than any of us can afford",19 favorites,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin', '/favorited/2/8680795']",2025-01-30 21:14:00,Thursday

https://www.metafilter.com/207423/Political-allies-dont-have-to-like-each-other,flug,https://www.metafilter.com/user/20111,"A point I would make that is, let's say . . . related to that made by the article is this: Almost always, in order to get our priorities accomplished, we need to lobby and pressure and cajol and armtwist (and everything else) politicians on our side of the aisle harder than we do those in the opposite party. We often have the idea that we need to use those tactics on the other side, the ""bad guys"", and when ""our guys"" are finally voted into office, we can just automatically expect our agenda to move forward like magic. Politics simply does not work that way. Even on topics that politicians naturally support, things they personally want to do, they have a very, very hard time making any headway on them without a huge groundswell of popular support - ideally, strongest from their own strongest supporters - pushing them along the way. There are a few reasons for this.  But high among them is that politicians are always elected by a large and diverse coalition of supporters. They make many promises and have many priorities - usually related to various interest groups among their supporters - along the way. Once in office, any officeholder has only limited time and attention.  You might have 20 or 50 or 100 items on your agenda or ""campaign promise list"".  In reality, you have capacity to maybe move 2 or 3 of them significantly at any given time.  And maybe you have another 5 or 10 on the back burner, ready to move up to highest priority if an opportunity arises. So the election is over and 95% of your supporting coalition heads home to celebrate, slap each other on the back about ""job well done"", and relaxes with a beer until the next election. Guess where their priorities end up, on the list of 1-3 on the front burner, 5-10 on the back burner, and the remaining 90 left closed up in the back cupboard? And guess what happens to the priorities of that 5% of your supporting coalition that makes a point to keep active and keep the pressure on, via personal visits, messages, rallies, general organizing, continued donations, or whatever the case may be? Yup, their priorities are the ones moved to the front of the priority list, and those are the ones that actually have a chance of moving forward. (Even in this case, there is no guarantee .  But they have a chance - while the priorities locked away in the back cupboard don't.) Elections are only the first part of the political battle, and lobbying the politicians who are ostensibly on your side is vastly more important than those in the opposing party. In Re: to the article, this kind of lobbying of the leaders on your own side is often interpreted as backstabbing, internecine warfare, and all that.  We have to be adult enough, and smart enough, to see a little beyond that.  Often the most vociferous disagreements are among those who are basically on the same side of things, but have different ideas about the details or implementation. The intent and seriousness of such disagreements, however, should not be overexaggerated.  The ""other guys"" are still the common enemy, and disagreements with them run far, far deeper. And people who spend all day arguing heatedly with each other over relative nuances can still form a completely united front in opposition to the other side's complete nonsense. But absolutely, we must speak up and lobby our own side most of all.  It is the only way to move our priorities forward in a  political system.

I'm aware of this personally because I've seen it happen to people I've personally known for years, who were (and maybe still are, at their core) pretty normal and reasonable people.

Then there is a issue of who defines what left is (https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/51283-liberal-left-conservative-and-right-americans-identify-their-ideology) , because it's noted in US poll data that nobody gives it a definition. That's because it is an emotional ideology, an orthodoxy of sorts, which is not workable in any coalition. If someone was raised in a household where liberals were despised and orthodoxy ruled, they will be tempted by a replacement certainty for their former stale dogma, because emotionally surrendering childhood certainty is the most difficult. That orthodox certainty is not found in liberalism, because it was always an opposition to the same kind of cultural authority. It was always seeking equality in daily living, here and now, and not waiting around for voters to convert to a divine political doctrine before it can hope to become right of law. The bad news is that Harris didn't lose because of anything she could control in the last two months as an unknown. The opposition was years on the making, in front and behind the scenes with both calculated silence and strategic bombast. The opposition ran an ad in all swing states introducing her, where she explains from an old interview (before she had a national political advisor perhaps) her willingness to give prisoners gender-affirming surgery. They ran it day and night tens of thousands of times, and anyone checking the polls after the first weeks knew it was working to write her off in swing states",3 favorites,"['https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/51283-liberal-left-conservative-and-right-americans-identify-their-ideology', '/favorited/2/8681383']",2025-02-01 08:32:00,Saturday

https://www.metafilter.com/207423/Political-allies-dont-have-to-like-each-other,flabdablet,https://www.metafilter.com/user/20036,"All politics, in every system of governance ever, is about compromise Hard agree... between ideals and reality. ...not so much. I see the compromises that define the political game as being between negotiating entities, not between ideals and reality. Reality doesn't negotiate, and behaving as if it will is pretty much the definition of insanity. The prizes go to those who can make the best compromises, however shitty they may be in the short term. Hard agree... It will never be otherwise. Not the whole picture, though. Politics regularly goes through periods where an ascendant ideology is so dominant that compromise is relegated to fiddling about at the margins while the big stuff is handled via the raw exercise of power. We're in such a period now. Compromise, in the political sense, happens where people with conflicting opinions on what to do about reality negotiate in good faith toward an outcome that both sides can live with. But there has been precious little good faith in US politics since Newt Gingrich first showed the Republicans how intransigence, demonization of dissent and shameless abuse of process would work better for them. The Democrats have kept on behaving as if he'd never done that; they seem so stuck in idealism about the way party politics is supposed to work as to ignore the reality of how it actually does now. On the public policy front, it seems to me that the main thing that has gone wrong in the US (and, by extension and influence, in the world at large) over the last half-century has been the total dominance of laissez-faire neoliberal economics, a set of interlocking right-wing ideas premised on the claim that allowing free markets to operate with as little interference from governments as possible will necessarily yield the best social outcomes, and that attempts to regulate them and/or constrain their worst excesses amount to ""distortions"" that must axiomatically reduce their ""efficiency"" in ways that are both unjust and wasteful. The Clinton Administration marked the complete capitulation of Democratic Party policymakers to neoliberalism, and what we've seen since then from the Republicans has been increasingly desperate attempts at brand differentiation based on increasingly vicious confected culture wars rather than any serious public policy disagreement. Neoliberal economics is a handful of tiny kernels of useful insight buried in a huge steaming pile of reeking horseshit, and rooting public policy in it obviously makes everything worse for everybody but a small coterie of obscenely wealthy families, but the US public has simply not been presented with any opportunity to vote against it. The only real choice the public has had since Clinton has been which side of the culture wars to be on. The Tea Party movement started out as a bit of astroturfing to further those culture wars, an attempt to deflect and corral the growing sense of resentment against the increasingly obvious failures of neoliberal economics to give the little guy anything even close to a break. But it got out of hand and just ate the Republican Party, with the result that that party is now completely in thrall to the grifters who originally funded the TP, the incompetents who actually took its ""principles"" seriously, and the asshats who cannot be dissuaded from saying the quiet parts out loud. With the loudest such asshat now installed in the Oval Office, culture wars devised as a party marketing tool have morphed into an actual war against trans people particularly and anybody doing anything deemed ""woke"" more generally. Meanwhile, an actual genocide with bipartisan US support proceeds apace in the Middle East. And yet, to the extent that the Grift Party even has an economic strategy, it's still neoliberal: free market good, taxes bad! Well, except for tariffs, because President Camacho thinks those are somehow not taxes on account of as how the name is different. Sooner the purists accept that and start bargaining for the best compromise possible, the better for them and their causes, and for everybody else. To the extent that I agree with this, the purists I think it's best addressed to are the free-market, minimal-government kind who have actually had their hands on the levers of power for most of my lifetime. Trouble is, though, that there is currently nobody that any of those people feel any need to compromise with . Neoliberal economics is still the driving force behind the ship of state, even as the reality-based community continues to sound all kinds of alarms about its imminent collision with the multiple icebergs that the ship's officers persistently refuse to see dead ahead. The reality-based community itself, meanwhile, remains so marginalized that we're almost never even allowed to come close to an opportunity to start hammering out compromises. So I have no objection at all to loud leftist voices making even quite overblown arguments against neoliberal economics or for the upholding of humanitarian law. As politics currently stands, the only path to power left for the Left lies in shifting the Overton window. Assets taxes levied on wealthy families and paying more than lip service to both international and domestic humanitarian law will never become things that are available to compromise on until there's substantial public demand for them",3 favorites,['/favorited/2/8681653'],2025-02-01 20:04:00,Saturday

India is a major point of interest in that he feels there is true collegiality between the Indian people and the lingering British presence, i.e., that they lived and worked in harmony after India declared its independence. That was his repeated stance for what he hoped to see in the American South and much broader United States. I have a pitiful amount of knowledge about post-Independence British and Indian relations, so I honestly don't know how real  the relationship was between formerly oppressed and the oppressors.

That's the bop on the nose, right there. Of course it pre-dates our current struggles, as anyone who has railed against the corporate lockdown of the Democratic party can tell you. Unfortunately, even the slightly-less-malevolent corporate overlord vision of that group is out the window now. I have come to see development of social media and the Internet more broadly as analogous to the development of the printing press. There were several generations of remarkable turmoil, revolutions both successful and failed, and lots and lots of violence that followed in its wake, due to the fact that the elite of the previous communications regime were unable to dominate the new one. We are in the beginning of that now. Unfortunately, despite initial appearances, the new information technology regime concentrates power rather than distributing it. This is in direct contrast to print, which was a wildly democratizing technology. Note that this raises the question of radio and television. Radio, I think, is relevant here (as a driver of both world wars), but television, primarily because it followed so closely in the heels of the world wars (with all that entails), is not. Regardless, neither of those technologies was nearly as disruptive as print was, because they were controllable by the power elite that had risen to the top under the communication technology regime of print media. I think we are at this deeper level of disruption now, closer in scope and magnitude to print, which was, in my view, far greater than radio or TV. Regardless, whatever positives emerge will have to do so amidst the chaos of this new regime. Notably, this is the first communications technology to provide centralzable information knowledge about the targets/consumers of information to those at the center of power who control the communication networks.

This is the ancient indoctrination they entered the voting booth with, a heavenly-bestowed prosperity by obedient living, not taxing the rich to not offend the deity. A well-adjusted critic can be forgiven for thinking we can collectively solve the problems we think we understand, but they may need to consider the way humans are born and raised in batch quantity (and how they aren't raised*). Instituting democratic reforms in places healing from civil war has proven more difficult than imagined, with reforms opposed by traditionalists with no common agreement on parliamentary process. One obvious solution is to give democratic control to governing agencies themselves, acting as parliament. It's more democratic in terms of goals, with rule by competence, and avoids bribery elections. The populace doesn't need to pretend it has to vote for enshrining their culture if they systematize the leading product of their culture. Note that such agencies are attacked by the current US administration, which indicates who and what they fear most. *The less autonomy a child is given, the more they will try to assert control over every tiny little thing, in an attempt to get it back.

It's just the kind of conservatism identified by the prophet Wilhoit (https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288) seven years ago: the ingroup is beyond reproach and therefore worthy of protection, while outgroups are responsible for all the world's ills and must therefore be kept in their place. Wilhoit says ""There is nothing more or else to it, and there never has been, in any place or time"" and although that's essentially correct, it downplays the extent to which people who subscribe to this brand of conservatism are unmoored from reality. The simple fact is that there is no discernible moral difference between anybody's ingroup and their assorted outgroups. We're all just people. We all suck to about the same extent, statistically speaking; the differences between groups of us are differences of circumstance, not of character. So the idea that some arbitrarily selected group is more deserving of the protection of the law is just plain incorrect on its face. I find it completely unsurprising when people willing to ignore that blatantly obvious fact also prove willing to ignore pretty much any other blatantly obvious fact that might likewise challenge their tiny, self-centred worldviews. Facts such as In A Pandemic, Vaccines And Masking And Avoiding Crowds Are Good Actually, or Acquiring Territory By Force Is Immoral And Illegal Even If It's Us Or Our Allies Doing It, or De-Sequestering Fossil Carbon Has Become Too Expensive To Justify, or OMG Elon Musk Is Such A Shithead. The other point that Wilhoit downplays is the extent to which a tendency toward conservatism correlates with a lack of self-awareness. Conservatives almost always behave as if whatever tendency they're complaining about in others is not something they also do themselves, usually to a much worse extent, and often put ludicrously on show by the ways in which they choose to frame and present those very complaints.

""Wholesale repudiation of the Enlightenment at the dawn of an as-yet-unseen New Order"" seems to be overstating things. To say the least. Most of our fellow humans are not terribly good at knowing things, as opposed to just having beliefs or opinions about them. Being good at knowing things involves both practicing admitting that you were wrong (because you can't learn anything, after a certain point, without falsifying something you thought you knew, and giving that something up) and encountering new ""knowledge"" with an attitude of ""why would you believe that?"" These are not things that are systematically taught, so far as I can tell. In particular, most Americans have always been both shockingly ignorant and also not too friendly to the Bill of Rights. I have seen Sunday newspaper features from 100 years ago, bemoaning the abject ignorance of the nations high-school graduates, citing their inability to name the dates of the Civil War or to even mention major events of the then-pretty-recent war with Spain. I seem to recall reading back in the 1970s, about a pollster asking a random sample of Americans if certain freedoms would be Good Ideas, followed by a list of the Bill of Rights, with the reaction that no, most of those ought not to be allowed. Our information environment right now is dominated by the fact that there are no effective, undiluted, out-and-proud pro-D voices among news media outlets. All of the legacy media are objectively pro-R, or they would have spent the last 25 years documenting how the R Party has transitioned from ""political Party"" to ""subversive criminal organization dedicated to minority rule."" The place of objective, balanced news media as it existed during the latter half of the 20th century has ceased to exist. Journalism now can choose between being pro-R or pro-D, and trying to split the difference makes them firmly pro-R. I don't know how Ds get pro-D media orgs, but I do know that if they try to build such they have to refrain from censoring them over sacred cows. Any legit pro-D journalism outfit would have been holding D officeholders' feet to the fire over arms supplies to Israel during the last year, for example. And I have a hard time imagining the current institutional leadership of the D Party being OK with that",4 favorites,['/favorited/2/8673707'],2025-01-15 11:17:00,Wednesday

The pushback is not so much against that, which I expect most contributors here would file under ""no shit, Sherlock"". It's against the idea that this is any kind of new behaviour for authoritarians, who have a long and ugly record of suppressing and/or killing off anybody who seeks to draw public attention to flaws in their ideology on the basis of actual facts. It's also against this: When I first wrote about the need for new political terminology, in 2017, I struggled to come up with better terms. But now the outlines of a popular political movement are becoming clearer, and this movement has no relation at all to the right or the left as we know them. She's talking about the nativist horseshit responsible for Brexit and the rise of TFG and the backlash against immigration into Europe and this is absolutely a right-wing project. The technologies upon which modernity is built have long been sufficiently advanced to be indistinguishable from magic, corroding a public immunity to woo that was never particularly strong to begin with. Obscurantism in the form of simple wrong answers to complex questions has been on a steady rise for my whole lifetime. But only the Right has been weaponizing it politically for all that time. Applebaum writes: The terms right-wing and left-wing come from the French Revolution, when the nobility, who sought to preserve the status quo, sat on the right side of the National Assembly, and the revolutionaries, who wanted democratic change, sat on the left. Those definitions began to fail us a decade ago, when a part of the right, in both Europe and North America, began advocating not caution and conservatism but the destruction of existing democratic institutions. In its new incarnation, the far right began to resemble the old far left. In some places, the two began to merge. If Applebaum honestly believes that the defining character of the Right only began to change a decade ago, she's fooling herself (as conservatives are wont to do). The Right has never been about preserving the status quo per se; it has always been about preserving privilege . In the words of the Prophet: As the core proposition of conservatism is indefensible if stated baldly, it has always been surrounded by an elaborate backwash of pseudophilosophy, amounting over time to millions of pages.

One tendency is a simple-minded rebellion against authority, which can turn into a rebellion against reality. Ideas spring up in the laziest manner, based on feels and vibes, and get handed around by social pressure. Supporting the wacky idea is only a way to signify membership in the in group,  nobody cares if it's true or not. The other tendency is the turn a small number of right wingers have done towards esoteric, occult, or unusual religious or ""philosophical"" orientations. There are some  dark enlightenment types in this group, some Yarvins, Bannons, Thiels, but they're not numerous. I can see where the first tendency might create a pipeline to the second for a small number of people, but the majority of the current right wing don't have the patience or the brainpower to take on a genuine occult path or religious conversion. Example: Hegseth's religious tattoos have no foundation beyond cheering for a team. He has the intellectual heft of a drunk football hooligan. Or, consider Thiel, who seems to be backsliding into word salad rather than doing the hard work to be consistent or coherent.

Don't let the galloper proceed to another arguement. It's true, and : you have to hold the galloper's feet to the fire, which means you have to control certain things about the situation. In an in-person debate, you can use that weak argument and the rules of the debate that mandate it continue until the timed ending to get your teeth into the argument and bring the debate to a halt while you humiliate the other person. Essentially, effective debate is all about the emotional spectacle. You force everyone to watch you while you make the other person explain in small words why they made an argument that is very bad and contradicts lots of beliefs held in common (or supposed to be held in common) by the audience. But the tactic relies on knowing what the audience will find humiliating to watch. I don't think it's very effective for Trump because frankly, the man's verbal acumen isn't what is drawing his fans. What is drawing his fans is the fact that he pushes boundaries until he is either forced with consequences to obey or he is distracted by some other objective.

Unlike psychoanalysis, which has had brief flourishes but now seems somewhat doomed compared to its more accessible offshoots, Marxism is the victorian invention that continually smothers its children by demanding a return to origins.  The new Capital translation is doing extremely well on Amazon, for instance (not quite as well as the corpse and protocorpse of Friedman and Sowell respectively), whereas the more accessible offshoots are...where?  There are two or three little primers on socialism published in the past twenty-five years and none of them can draw a straight line between Marx and the thing capitalism is currently becoming.  Step back a level to more inaccessible books, and there's a million of them, but that's kind of the article's point I guess?  Marxism is hidden from the working class, at a time when they really could use some theory to understand why things are so bad.  (Although when people try--well, check out the bitchy little chuckle the article gives to Erik Olin Wright.  The recommendation of City of Quartz is doubly weird because that book is thirty-five years old and five hundred pages long .) I think it's likely that we're done with Marx as a useful tool.  He has become a field of esoteric study, and a source of memes (the latter of which probably explains the sales of the new translation), but the change socialism envisions has to involve workers who understand what's happening and can make meaningful decisions, and there's no sign that Marx can provide that to anyone.

Economics and ""political science"" and the humanities have been split off and separated. Most academic economists have never read Marx in any detail (beyond maybe reading the Manifesto and thinking the labor theory of value is dumb) and only know of e.g. David Ricardo as the originator of a very basic trade model. When I read The Communist Manifesto back in college it seemed pretty outdated (""we've got a middle class now!""), but Marx and the other 19th-century political economists have a lot of useful analysis of our current condition, both because they were seeing it with fresher eyes and because they weren't limited by our current academic departmental silos and career incentives. There are core parts of Marx that are still obviously resonant today: take the idea that the ownership of things shapes our interests and how we identify ourselves in the world. (Or more traditionally: our classes are constituted by our relationship to the means of production.) There's a lot more to Marx than that, but just caring about who owns what gets you a good part of the way to a solid politics, because you can't help but to ask why they own it, and the answers the capitalists manufacture in their defense are never as useful as someone uncritically accepting the status quo.

IMO, Marx's future view of ideal communism was a product of his Industrial Revolution context, just like the 1950s gave us science-fiction views of flying cars. However, I think Marx's critique—that capitalism has an inherent tendency toward crisis , based on the inequality between labor and capital—has been borne out through many, increasingly frequent large-scale economic crises as the volume and speed of capital's flows has increased. Others have different perspectives, I'm well aware. Mondragon and the Community Economies folks both operate on a reading of Volume 2 of Capital that looks at who appropriates the value of different folks' labor: capitalist appropriation is capitalist, but there are plenty of nonmarket and alternative-market forms of appropriation, from barter to gift to government work to feudal and enslavement economies: there's a strong case to be made that patriarchal family organizations where women perform domestic labor are forms of feudalism, and I don't think there's anything one can call American prison labor other than enslavement, which is coerced labor sustained by violence. IMO, saying Marx is out-of-date is like saying Muhammad and Confucius and Sappho are out-of-date: well, yeah. But we wouldn't think the ways we do today without them, and their ideas are still worth paying attention to. tl;dr: capitalism isn't forever or default. It was preceded by mercantilism, and it will be followed by something else",5 favorites,"['https://www.communityeconomies.org', '/favorited/2/8671039']",2025-01-09 18:33:00,Thursday

(C'mon, he calls himself a ""rogue academic."" LOL.) So he cherry-picks the hell out of his examples. He offers a glancing reference, for example, to the gender dynamics of academic Marxism, but has zero insight about how the Marxian critique led to aspects of feminist economics that have had profound effects on studies of GNP and other phenomena—see, for example the work of feminist economist Duncan Ironmonger, development economist Timothy Mitchell, and even (I admit I'm reaching a bit here, but not much) the anti-Malthusian work of Elinor Ostrom.

I, personally, think that is a nonsense idea, despite being common to the point that most people probably have no idea they hold that assumption to begin with",4 favorites,['/favorited/2/8671063'],2025-01-09 20:34:00,Thursday
https://www.metafilter.com/207107/Where-does-American-socialism-stop-and-American-Marxism-begin,Brian B.,https://www.metafilter.com/user/21032,"Marx is outdated as an economist and a social critic. He reflected the dominant metalism of his time, which was an international contest that led to Africa being targeted for its gold. Marx was a metalist himself, and a colonialist (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/) . He believed communism was the next stage of modern industrial society, so everyone should advance sequentially. He was racially critical of Africans. His main economics was rejected for institutionalized central banking and modern currency where redistribution of money was a social goal and is democratically achievable. But even this progress has been stymied by bad associations with the confiscation of real property to be held in common, or Marx's outdated conception of redistribution. His sociology of class opposition promoted the term proletariat , which literally translates as ""breeders"" or those who produce offspring. His academic feud with Malthus led to his lifelong efforts to remove any blame from overpopulating. His main prophecy of inevitable communism was ill-founded on a dialectic that he invented, as a pseudo-logic. Marxism gave rise to a categorical hate and violence commonly seen between fanatical dogmatic sects, whether he intended it or not. His net influence on the human attitude towards each other has been firm opposition from adherents of faith against social reform, and the demonizing of atheism as synonymous with adherence to Marx",1 favorite,"['https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/', '/favorited/2/8671674']",2025-01-11 11:09:00,Saturday

(His slogan outlining the utility of the individual from abilities to needs describes slavery, though intended to describe communism). Christian fundamentalism owes its modern existence to Marx. They responded to an existential threat by demanding that people take their own beliefs literally and politically, because communism replaces Christianity, per your comment. But where Marxism was disproved on the details, such as the labor theory of value or diminishing returns on profit or state central planning, these failures are beside the main feature, which is a belief in a structured authority that establishes reward and punishment for loyalty against a constant foe, the defeat of which brings salvation or utopia",0,[],2025-01-12 06:56:00,Sunday
