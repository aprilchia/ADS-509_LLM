Orban returned to power in 2010 after eight years in opposition with an ambition to overhaul Hungary after what he deemed a failed transition from communism to a market-based democracy over the previous two decades. He promised his party hegemony for decades to come. To ensure this, he replaced the constitution and revamped electoral rules to make it easier for Fidesz to win commanding majorities in parliament. He appointed loyalists to independent institutions, including the courts, and blurred the lines between politics and business, academia and culture.

The most important global political trend of the past decade has been the collapse of the center-right. America’s Republican establishment feebly folded in the face of the MAGA insurgency. Britain’s Conservative Party, often described as “the natural party of government,” is struggling to survive as Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK sucks up the political oxygen. Even in Germany, where the taboo against ethnonationalism is stronger, Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative CDU is neck-and-neck (https://archive.ph/EMVHz) with the AfD in opinion polls. After holding power in advanced economies for much of the post-war era, backed by an increasingly affluent suburbanite middle class, these historic center-right conservative blocs are losing ground to radical-right alternatives. The new parties promote aggressive policies on migration, disregard economic orthodoxy and are much more open to authoritarianism. Taken together, their rise creates a crisis for liberal democracy. The next wave of elections, notably the 2026 US midterms and France’s presidential vote in 2027, will seriously test whether center-right candidates are able to return to relevance.

It is evident that Moscow aims to strengthen its influence in Hungary and destroy the opposition movement in the country by creating a replica of the Russian regime, with its corresponding level of freedom of speech, political rights, and civil liberties. Following a mafia-style logic, Moscow is pulling Orbán and his entourage into corrupt schemes that deepen his dependence on Russia and expand Hungary’s capacity for subversive activity inside the EU and NATO."" ( 2026 Hungarian parliamentary election (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Hungarian_parliamentary_election) : Opinion polls (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Hungarian_parliamentary_election#Opinion_polls) ) In an interview with The Financial Times , Péter Magyar, the leader of Hungary’s opposition Tisza Party, said that his party’s servers had been attacked by a cybercriminal group whose traces lead back to Russia. Magyar also drew attention to a recent statement by Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), which accused the EU, Ukraine, and his political movement of conspiring to overthrow Orbán. The politician called these accusations “blatant disinformation” and said they show that “Putin has begun interfering in the campaign.” [...] The Russian cyber operation targeting Hungary’s Tisza Party represents a deliberate attempt by Moscow to weaken the only Hungarian political force capable of challenging Viktor Orbán’s pro-Kremlin course. The attack fits a long-standing SVR pattern: pre-election disruption, selective kompromat harvesting, and shaping the political environment in an EU/NATO state in Russia’s favour. The operation is not isolated. It is part of a broader Russian strategy to keep Hungary aligned with Moscow, undermine EU unity, and prevent the emergence of a Hungarian government that would revert to Western strategic discipline. [...] Orbán provides the Kremlin with: a veto within EU institutions, a spoiler in NATO, a normalizer of relations between Moscow and Washington, an internal European amplifier for anti-Ukraine rhetoric. A Tisza electoral rise threatens to dismantle this architecture. For Moscow, the most efficient method to protect Orbán is to delegitimize, disrupt, and compromise his main challenger, especially one not yet hardened against foreign interference. Pre-empt democratic change and weaken opposition infrastructure SVR and FSB cyber units target parties that: are organizationally young, lack robust cyber-defense, rely heavily on digital mobilization. Tisza fits all criteria. By striking early, Russia aims to: steal internal communications, map donor networks, identify vulnerabilities, collect kompromat for selective leaks during campaign season. This is the same blueprint Russia deployed in Montenegro (2016), Czech Republic (2018–2021), and Moldova (2023). Control the information environment before the next Hungarian elections Russian cyber operators typically attack 18–24 months before an electoral cycle, securing: psychological pressure on opposition leadership, internal confusion, resource exhaustion, opportunities to plant disinformation about internal conflicts. Any leak—authentic or fabricated—could be used to portray Tisza as: corrupt, Western-controlled, divided, incompetent. Narrative warfare is the end goal. also btw... Young Americans are increasingly rejecting the Democratic and Republican parties, a new poll shows (https://apnews.com/article/poll-independents-moderates-republicans-democrats-trump-ba353eb6807fd854f5b6e6de52d152fa) - ""Just under half, 45%, of U.S. adults now identify as independents, a new Gallup survey (https://news.gallup.com/poll/700499/new-high-identify-political-independents.aspx) found. That's a substantial shift from 20 years ago, when closer to one-third of Americans said they didn't identify with the Democrats or Republicans."" This group appears, increasingly, to be driven by their unhappiness with the party in power, according to Gallup’s analysis. That’s a dynamic that could be good for Democrats in this year’s midterm elections, but doesn’t promise lasting loyalty. Independents have gravitated toward the Democrats over the past year when asked which party they lean toward, Gallup found, but attitudes toward the party (https://news.gallup.com/poll/696635/neither-party-dominates-favorability-trust.aspx) haven’t gotten warmer. That suggests that the Democrats’ gains are probably more related to independents’ increasingly sour views (https://news.gallup.com/poll/692879/independents-drive-trump-approval-second-term-low.aspx) of President Donald Trump. Younger people, in particular, are rejecting the parties at much higher rates than older generations. More than half of Generation Z and Millennials identify as political independents, while a majority of older generations side with a party. That’s different from the past, when more young adults identified with the Democrats or the Republicans.

The University's Regents want to get their unruly faculty in line with the current American presidential administration's broader pressure on public higher education to conform with its political beliefs and priorities. Do the increasing restrictions on expression and inquiry in higher education themselves merit a course of study? How soon will we get to the inevitable case of a professor getting fired for teaching a course about censorship? ( previously (https://www.metafilter.com/210291/Texas-AandM-fires-English-Professor-for-Teaching-about-Gender) ) Depending upon the nature of the institutions where they're taught, university courses can and do study censorship, free speech, and the nature of what can and cannot be debated in the public sphere—not with practical or job-related outcomes, but with philosophical, ethical, and methodological outcomes. The ""A&M"" in the name of the institution in the linked NYT story comes from the University's former identity as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, with its founding focus as a public land-grant school oriented toward more practical, vocational, and job-related concerns. The conservative position on higher education in the United States sees colleges and universities as preparing holders of bachelor's degrees for jobs. Republicans argue for higher education as workplace training. However, their workplace training arguments conflict with the conservative positions of the (sometimes same) Republicans who insist on the relevance of foundational texts to higher education. Books like The Republic by Plato, the Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle, Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding by John Locke, and Discourse on Method by René Descartes (or, in the United States, Common Sense by Thomas Paine, The Federalist Papers , the Articles of Confederation, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Bill of Rights) cannot be considered job training, and vocationally-oriented conservatives do not have answers for where such concerns fit into university curricula. In some ways, the NYT headline seems to invoke debates over what can be studied in higher education, including discussions of the Sokal Hoax (https://www.metafilter.com/210894/The-journal-did-not-fold) recently revived by its would-be successor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair) , and older (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/20/harold-bloom-defence-of-western-greats-blinded-him-to-other-cultures) debates (https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/cultural-literacy-creator-carries-on-campaign/2016/10) about the competing roles of canonicity and relevance (https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo209142619.html) in higher education (https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393330700) .

The rivers and basins of the Tibetan Plateau are clustered close together in a choke point known as the Three Parallel Rivers. At their narrowest point, the Mekong, Salween, and Yangtze Rivers are within about 32 kilometers of each other, with even shorter distances between basins. This means that if a dam or pump station were placed on the Mekong or Salween, these rivers’ flows could be diverted into the Yangtze basin, changing the endpoint of the flowpath by thousands of miles. In this way, even a small intervention sufficiently upriver could have an enormous impact on the flow balance of these complex systems... Upstream nations have too much leverage to be convinced to share water resources more equitably. The solution might be to focus on reducing downstream nations’ reliance on those resources in the first place... With the advent of cheap solar power, the last chokepoint that has frustrated global desalination efforts is finally loosening. The cost of the energy used by desalination plants over time dwarfs the initial cost of their construction, so the availability of cheap solar power greatly increases their viability. The ease with which countries can store water also means that solar power’s chief drawback, intermittency, may be much less of a problem here than in other uses. also btw...

Seven years of abnormally dry weather coincided with rapid industrial growth in the nation’s biggest oil-export hub, stretching supplies of fresh water. Municipal leaders are at odds over what to do. The city council recently halted work on a desalination plant that would have treated seawater after cost estimates spiraled to more than $1 billion and sparked outrage among some residents. The issue also tapped into long-simmering resentment of the growing industrial presence of major water users such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Koch Industries LLC, Celanese Corp., and Occidental Petroleum Corp. If the drought doesn’t break in the next 12 months or so, even stricter usage limits may be necessary that would curb available supplies by 25%, officials have warned. “Oh, yes, it’ll impact” industry, said Brian Williams, general manager of San Patricio Municipal Water District, which counts large companies among its biggest customers. “The current drought, it looks like it’s not going to let up. Everybody’s considering what options are available out there.” Corpus Christi has grown from a remote 19th-century trading post to a critical nexus of the global oil, natural gas and chemical sectors. Since 2010, the city of 320,000 people has seen more than $57 billion of direct capital investment (https://www.ccredc.com/index.php?src=documents&srctype=download&refno=88) , according to economic development figures. The deepwater port is an export hub for Permian Basin crude and gas while the coastline is home to six refineries, an LNG terminal and several massive petrochemical plants. About half of the city’s water supply now goes to commercial and industrial customers at a time when the inland river systems that feed the region are drying up. Choke Canyon Reservoir and Lake Corpus Christi, the city’s main water sources, are currently just 12% full (https://stage3.cctexas.com/) , as severe drought conditions constrain river flows for hundreds of miles around. Lawn watering already is prohibited (https://corpus.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/805a30fa71304195bc45b36529bf40b3) in the city and severe restrictions are in effect for things like washing cars and maintaining swimming pools. The two main reservoirs are forecast to run so low by November 2026 (https://www.corpuschristitx.gov/department-directory/corpus-christi-water/water-supply-dashboard-english/) that an emergency declaration will mandate even stricter curtailments. “Everybody’s worried about that date,” said John Byrum, executive director of Nueces River Authority, which manages surface-water resources in the region. The struggle is pitting residents against heavy industry that provides jobs and tax revenues for schools, libraries and public safety. State climatologists aren’t expecting (https://www.corpuschristitx.gov/media/q52n0q1f/20250919_memo_water-supply-projects-update.pdf) the drought to break any time soon.

David Roberts: And do you anticipate, once you show that this works the way you say it works, that there’s going to be a shift change in the speed and scale and investment and et cetera? Is that sort of the idea here? Carlos Araque: I think so. I think once you see the first one and you can look at it not as a vision, but as a real business with costs, with revenues, with profit margins, that’s when it starts to become a thing that people will want to do at scale. And we divide the world in tiers. We don’t say it’s all the same. We say, let’s unlock tier one first. That means that resource is within the first five kilometers. That’s about 100 gigawatts. That’s about 5% of the world population. Let’s unlock that one. Let’s do the one, two, three project. That just unlocks it. Then do the next tier. Right. For that, you need the drill to be performing at maximum ability. And that one you repeat first, second, third project, and it goes, the third tier is a world push. That to me is more an industrial push. It’s not the thing that one company does... So that’s how you really unlock this progressively going from shallow to deeper, but always hot. Always hot.

California's high levels of solar radiation and abundant areas of sparsely populated desert also mean the state is better positioned than most to deploy solar farms at massive scale. Even so, several other U.S. states across the South and Southwest can expect similar cuts to fossil fuel reliance if they also rolled out large solar and battery systems.
And with supplies of solar and battery systems steadily rising just as system costs steadily decline, state utilities that can pull the trigger on expansions to solar and battery systems can expect quick returns on their investments. At the same time, with benchmark U.S. natural gas prices this year averaging around 37% more than 2024's levels, according to LSEG, states that can cut use of natural gas can expect significant savings in their fossil fuel purchase bills."" Although overshadowed so far by booming data center demand and the U.S. government's gutting of clean energy policies, California's rapid scaling of solar farms and battery systems may yet emerge as 2025's most significant power story. California's mammoth solar farms have generated more electricity than the state's fossil fuel power plants for a record-long stretch so far in 2025, setting a new marker for energy transition progress in the United States. In terms of the share of California's electricity generation mix, solar farms accounted for a record 39% of total utility-supplied generation during January to July, up from 33% during the same period in 2024. For comparison, the state of Texas, which has the second-largest solar power footprint in the U.S., secured 10.4% of its electricity from solar farms so far this year. [...] As the solar share of California's electricity mix has climbed, the electricity generation share from fossil fuels has steadily fallen and hit new lows of just 26% so far in 2025. That compares to a national average fossil fuel share of 55% so far in 2025, and cements California's position as by far the leading state in terms of clean electricity deployment. CRITICAL MASS California's utilities have rapidly built out capacity of battery storage systems alongside solar power output since 2022, so that the state's abundant solar power can be deployed to maximum effect. In previous years, California's power system was frequently overrun by the massive solar output levels generated during the middle of the day, which was when solar output peaked just as total state power consumption neared its daily lows. Thanks to a nearly threefold rise in battery storage capacity since 2022 to more than 14,000 megawatts (MW), according to data portal Cleanview, California's utilities can now store some of that excess solar output and deploy it when demand peaks. FOSSIL FALLS The growing scale of California's solar plus battery networks is allowing utilities to scale back fossil fuel reliance at an unprecedented pace. Historically, California's use of fossil fuels peaked during the summer when use of power-hungry air conditioners is highest. Thanks to rapidly rising solar and battery capacity, however, California's utilities have been able to make major cuts to fossil fuel deployment even during peak demand periods. In July 2025, total fossil fuel electricity output was just 36,416 GWh, according to Ember. That total marked a 40% plunge from July 2024, and was 36% below the July average from 2019 through 2024. Such a steep drop in fossil generation had a commensurate impact on associated emissions, which in July 2025 were 2.1 million metric tons of CO2 less than in July 2024, and by far the lowest for that month on record. Texas and California widen clean power lead over rest of US (https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/texas-california-widen-clean-power-lead-over-rest-us-2025-09-19/) [ ungated (https://archive.ph/qbDAF) ] - ""Texas and California are driving U.S. clean power supplies to record highs so far in 2025, and are building a widening lead over the rest of the country in terms of the share of total power generated from clean energy sources... Close to 74% of the wholesale power supplies generated within the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) came from clean sources during January to August, according to data from LSEG. That was by far the highest clean generation share on record for California, and compares to a 68% clean share for the same months last year and a 60% share for that period in 2023. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) - which covers most of Texas - generated 46.5% of its power from clean sources during January to August.

And that's why I need to speak out now."" So when I retired from ministry in 2016, I started paying attention again and I started by watching Fox News and pretty quickly I felt like they were showing me the world through a fun house mirror. They were trying to give me Donald Trump, too. And I just thought, ""This is insane. This is obviously insane."" But most of my Christian friends were going along with it. And again, the only difference between me and them is that I had stepped out of the echo chamber for years. So when I stepped back in, I saw how distorted their view of the world had become, you know, and maybe it had always been that distorted. And so that's how I'm here now. But I can't let myself forget where I came from. And that brings me back to Charlie Kirk... And one more, I think, deep and important disagreement I have with Charlie Kirk. I just have no idea how he could reconcile his constant appeals to truth with his support for Donald Trump, who is the most false politician in my lifetime. I don't understand how Kirk could claim to speak for truth when he spearheaded a movement whose entire currency is lies in service to an administration whose entire foundation is lies. And no matter how far down you go with the Trump administration, it's lies all the way down. And yet Charlie Kirk is now held up as a champion for truth. And I have no interest in tearing down his memory. But I do wish that people weren't already building him up into an idol. He was a human being. He's one whose faith, I think, was affected by the same nationalistic contaminants that mine was for many years. And to some extent, mine still is. I mean, that's one of the birthrights of American Christians. We all feed at the trough at least a little bit of that God and country slop, but it's wrong and it is a contaminant and Charlie Kirk's movement is gorging themselves on it. And that memorial service the other night was a bacchanalia of that stuff. One Bible Verse BLOWS UP MAGA's False Version of Christian Faith (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUkRpyHBaE) - ""In this video, I tackle a question I hear often: 'If it weren't for Donald Trump, would you still be open to the rest of what the GOP/MAGA movement stands for?'"" I used to think *yes*. But after 2016, the marriage between the religious right and MAGA woke me up—especially when I saw even “Christian” leaders abandon their convictions overnight. That’s when James 1:27 broke me open: “Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress *and* to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.” (NIV) This verse dismantles the pseudo‑Christian approach to politics—not only MAGA’s religious posture, but also my own old assumptions. It shows that real Christianity is about caring for the marginalized and preserving personal holiness—not imposing moral laws or seizing power. Retired Pastor: It's TRAGIC That the CHURCH Supports TRUMP! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnOLRVksOH4) - ""The church in America is in deep trouble."" The church has grasped after power and it's aligned itself with corrupt rulers who promise to protect the church, specifically the white evangelical wing of the church I talk to a lot because that's where I came from. And you know, maybe these rulers will throw evangelicals a bone on a pet issue or two, if the church will just put aside their reservations about the corruption and the abuse that those leaders are visiting on the nation. 80% of the white evangelical church in America has voted for Donald Trump and his movement after everything that they've learned about him in the past three presidential elections. That's a symptom of a movement that's lost the plot on what Jesus calls his people to be in this world. As a movement, they've ceased to be a blessing, but instead they've made themselves a curse. Rather than modeling the kingdom of God, rather than showing the world what it means to live by the way of Jesus and to show the beauty of the fruits of the spirit, this power-hungry, fearful, fleshly version of the church has drawn the rest of the country into its own dysfunction. And it's inflicting its own fear and loathing onto the rest of the world through the man Donald Trump and his movement, the MAGA movement that they more than any other group have forced on a country who recoils by and large from the world view that Trump represents. And I don't know what to do about that except to talk about it in the hopes that people will see the damage that's being done in the name of Christ.

(https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-crisis-what-next-public-health/) Armstrong, an infectious disease physician at University of Colorado Medicine, recently confronted one such loss in her practice in Colorado. Her patient had signs of what could be a cancer or could be an unusual infection — diagnoses that would require completely different treatment. Ordinarily, she would confirm an infection after sending a sample to the CDC for testing its lab would perform — the only one in the U.S. capable of doing so.

The CDC no longer has the capacity to do that, she was told, not disclosing the nature of the test to protect her patient’s privacy. 

“That directly impacted my patient,” she said. “It had a real-world, absolutely direct impact on a patient that I was evaluating and has led to a much, much more complicated situation.” Three senior CDC leaders resigned after the White House fired Director Susan Monarez less than a month into her tenure.  (https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/cdc-director-susan-monarez-removed-from-post-2f60725c) Monarez’s lawyers said she was removed for refusing to “rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives” from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The resigning officials said the shake-up threatened science with Demetre Daskalakis saying “our science is going to be compromised,” while Debra Houry warned vaccine policy was being set “before we had the data,” and Daniel Jernigan accused HHS of pressing him to alter settled safety studies. “The recent shooting at CDC is not why I am resigning,” Daskalakis wrote in his resignation letter. (https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/publichealth/117197) “My grandfather, who I am named after, stood up to fascist forces in Greece and lost his life doing so. I am resigning to make him and his legacy proud. I am resigning because of the cowardice of a leader that cannot admit that HIS and his minions' words over decades created an environment where violence like this can occur. I reject his and his colleagues' thoughts and prayers, and advise they direct those to people that they have not actively harmed.” Hundreds of CDC staff staged a walkout in Atlanta (https://www.commondreams.org/news/cdc-staff-walkout) with signs reading “Science not conspiracy” in support of Monarez and the officials who resigned.

China has begun the construction of a giant hydropower project at the earthquake-prone edge of the Tibetan plateau, a spectacular engineering feat that is central to Beijing’s enduring mission to become self-sufficient (https://archive.ph/ouIN9) in critical areas such as energy. The $167 billion facility will require digging tunnels that plunge through high mountains to harness the power of a river that sharply descends through the deepest and possibly longest canyon on the planet. If its planners succeed—after shrugging off objections from neighbors—the project could generate triple the output of the world’s largest hydroelectric facility, China’s Three Gorges Dam, which is big enough to power around 40 million Chinese homes... The plan, slated to be the world’s most expensive infrastructure project, will also plow money into a struggling Chinese economy and bring jobs and business to a remote and sensitive corner of China where Beijing is trying to engineer the loyalty of the Tibetan population (https://archive.is/xoQNr) . A planned $7 billion high-voltage transmission network will deliver electricity from the site in Tibet to Guangdong province, the economic center on China’s southeast coast, and the cities of Hong Kong and Macau. But the project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River has stirred accusations that it will give Beijing the power to strangle resources beyond its borders, where the river flows into northeastern India and then south through Bangladesh. Exclusive: China's new mega dam triggers fears of water war in India (https://archive.ph/qq8Gn) - ""India fears a planned Chinese mega-dam in Tibet will reduce water flows on a major river by up to 85% during the dry season, according to four sources familiar with the matter and a government analysis seen by Reuters, prompting Delhi to fast-track plans for its own dam to mitigate the effects."" The Indian government has been considering projects since the early 2000s to control the flow of water from Tibet's Angsi Glacier, which sustains more than 100 million people downstream in China, India and Bangladesh. But the plans have been hindered by fierce and occasionally violent resistance from residents of the border state of Arunachal Pradesh, who fear their villages will be submerged and way of life destroyed by any dam. Then in December, China announced that it would build the world's largest hydropower dam in a border county just before the Yarlung Zangbo river crosses into India. That triggered fears in New Delhi that its longtime strategic rival - which has some territorial claims in Arunachal Pradesh - could weaponize its control of the river, which originates in the Angsi Glacier and is known as the Siang and Brahmaputra in India. more... Explainer: Why China's neighbours are worried about its new mega-dam project (https://archive.ph/Cwgj8) - ""The plan involves five dams along a 50‑km stretch where the river plunges 2,000  metres off the Tibetan Plateau. First power is expected to be generated in the early‑to‑mid 2030s, but beyond that and the price tag, China has published little information about how it intends to build the project. That lack of information is compounding fears about water security in India and Bangladesh, which rely on the Brahmaputra for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water."" Beijing grabs old dam playbook to energise growth (https://archive.ph/6puLK) - ""While more hydropower will eventually help reduce China's greenhouse gas pollution, building it will add to them. It'll require around 30 million tons of cement, per Morgan Stanley, equivalent to two years of China's current production. It'll need plenty of steel, too. Those two industries combined account for almost a fifth of global carbon emissions."" Xi Ties His Legacy and China's Economy to $167 Billion Dam (https://archive.ph/UBxpu) - ""Sixty times the cement of the Hoover Dam, more steel than 116 Empire State Buildings and enough concrete to build a two-lane highway around the Earth five times — that's what will go into China's new $167 billion hydropower project in Tibet."" Engineers plan to drill tunnels from the top of the bend to the bottom, channeling water through turbines before sending it back into its natural course. It’s a system designed to minimize upstream and downstream disruption. But in practice, it would drain one of the river’s most ecologically rich stretches, and bring heavy construction to a seismically volatile region. The 8.6 magnitude Assam-Tibet earthquake (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/official19500815140934_30/executive) , one of the strongest ever recorded on land, happened in 1950 just 153 miles away from Nyingchi... The flipside is that the construction could unleash a cascade of environmental consequences. The Tibetan Plateau is often called the “Third Pole” because it holds more ice and snow than anywhere on Earth outside the Arctic and Antarctic. This frozen reservoir plays a powerful role in shaping jet streams and stabilizing South Asia’s climate. The surrounding basin is one of the richest biodiversity zones on the planet, home to more than 150 (https://www.biodiversity-science.net/EN/10.17520/biods.2024143) native species of fish — some teetering on the edge of extinction (https://austriaca.at/0xc1aa5572%200x003e4cd6.pdf) — as well as elusive snow leopards and red pandas. Why China's $167 Billion Mega-Dam Project in Tibet Is So Controversial (https://archive.ph/CfAM5) - ""Five 'cascade' dams will be built around the city of Nyingchi in the southeast of the autonomous region of Tibet. The structures will retain waters of the Yarlung Tsangpo, one of several major rivers that are sustained by Tibet's vast glaciers and provide drinking water, irrigation and hydro power for more than 1.3 billion people in ten countries... Chinese environmentalists have warned of irreversible damage to the Yarlung Tsangpo gorge, where the river drops 2,000 meters over a 50-kilometer (31-mile) stretch in an area that hosts a national nature reserve and is one of China's most biodiverse regions.""

Secret Xi Letter Revived India Ties After Trump Tariff Barrage (https://archive.ph/Bz3Fx) - ""The economic logic of improved ties is incontrovertible.

India, with its 1.4 billion youth-skewed population, could be a potential new market as China faces rising protectionism in the US, Europe and elsewhere. Indian officials, meantime, are increasingly realizing they need Chinese investment in factories if they're ever to meet Modi's fledgling ambition to boost manufacturing toward 25% of GDP.

In this wide ranging conversation Ornstein and FRDH host Michael Goldfarb analyze the current situation, discuss whether the 2026 Midterm elections will be free and fair and what can be done right now to push back on the radical path Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying to force America down."" At a time when so much of the media is either in denial about Trump's ultimate aims, or determined to normalise the damage he's doing, this is a refreshingly clear-eyed assessment of just how bad things are and where they're going next.

Oregon is stockpiling abortion medication in secret warehouses. Illinois is exploring digital sovereignty. California has $76 billion in reserves and is deciding how to deploy it. Three sources on those daily Zoom calls between Democratic AGs say the same phrase keeps coming up, though nobody wants to say it publicly: soft secession (https://cmarmitage.substack.com/p/its-time-for-americans-to-start-talking) ."" In the second essay (https://cmarmitage.substack.com/p/deport-republicans-a-practical-guide) , he explains more of the strategy: Start with federal tax resistance. Not individual but institutional. California's franchise tax board ""accidentally"" delays federal transfers. New York's banking system develops ""technical difficulties"" processing federal revenues. Illinois has ""compatibility issues"" with IRS systems. Make the federal government sue for every dollar. The leverage here is extraordinary. California alone sends over $500 billion annually to the federal government. New York adds another $300 billion. These aren't just numbers on a spreadsheet. This is the federal government's operating cash. Delay it by a month? The Treasury starts bouncing checks. Delay it by a quarter? Federal agencies shut down. The government can sue, sure. But lawsuits take years. Meanwhile, every delayed payment triggers another crisis, every technical difficulty requires weeks of troubleshooting, every system incompatibility needs months of expert review. Problems cascade into catastrophes while lawyers argue about jurisdiction. Meanwhile, states that are actually interested in running functioning governments, are free to do so.","['https://cmarmitage.substack.com/p/its-time-for-americans-to-start-talking', 'https://cmarmitage.substack.com/p/deport-republicans-a-practical-guide', 'https://cmarmitage.substack.com/', 'https://cmarmitage.substack.com/p/its-time-for-americans-to-start-talking', 'https://cmarmitage.substack.com/p/deport-republicans-a-practical-guide']",metafilter

Kindleberger powerfully argued that it was the absence of a willing and able hegemon —specifically, the United States’s failure to take on that role—in the interwar years that was was the root cause of the Great Depression’s depth and duration. Britain, the previous hegemon, had become too weak. America, the rising giant, was too parochial and inward-looking. Kindleberger’s insight was that global order is not self-organizing. It requires a state willing to provide public goods—market access, liquidity, coordination, and, when necessary, a lender of last resort. Without a hegemon to shoulder these burdens, the system devolves into beggar-thy-neighbor policies, competitive devaluations, and, ultimately, collapse. His analysis was not merely historical: it was a pointed warning to all who would assume that international capitalism can function without leadership. Kindleberger’s vision of hegemony is not about domination, but about responsibility—the willingness to act, often at some cost to oneself, for the stability of the whole. Robert Keohane broadened the concept beyond the study of purely international economic order in his 1984 After Hegemony: Cooperation and Discord in the World Political Economy . (Ironically, Keohane’s central point was that even though the U.S. could no longer be a successful hegemon its previous building of institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, GATT, and the UN meant that the international order it had constructed would continue—but the U.S.’s ability to be a successful hegemon was then rising, and would not fall back to below its 1970s level until the 2016 election of Donald Trump.) In the hands of Keohane and others like Stephen Krasner, Susan Strange, and John Ikenberry, “hegemony” became a framework for analyzing not only the provision of economic public goods, but also the construction and maintenance of security alliances, the shaping of international norms, and the creation of durable institutions. “Hegemonic stability theory” posited that the presence of a dominant, rule-setting power—be it the British Empire in the 19th century or the United States in the post-1945 era—was essential for the functioning of a liberal international system. When the hegemon was strong and engaged, the world saw relative peace, open markets, and institutional innovation; when the hegemon faltered or withdrew, the system became vulnerable to fragmentation, rivalry, and crisis... Economic hegemony is when a single nation both has the power and steps up to set the rules and provide the public goods that underpin the global economic system. This is not simply a matter of having the largest GDP or the deepest capital markets—although those certainly help—but of being the anchor of international finance, trade, and payments... the likelihood that the American economy will be strong enough to support economic hegemony in the future is now low. More important, the United States will not be trusted to follow-through. And a leader needs the confidence of others that there will be follow-through.

You need to get out.” The department [DHS] said the surgery center staff “assaulted law enforcement” and attempted to obstruct the arrest.",['https://apnews.com/article/ice-arrest-california-surgery-center-c827038f1a40227dc05ab1c28b048035'],metafilter

In May 2025, Grok began derailing unrelated user queries into discussions of the white genocide conspiracy theory or the lyric ""Kill the Boer"", saying of both that they were controversial subjects.[95][96][97][98] In one response to an unrelated question about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Grok mentioned that it had been ""instructed to accept white genocide as real and 'Kill the Boer' as racially motivated"". This followed an incident a month earlier where Grok fact-checked a post by Elon Musk about white genocide, saying that ""No trustworthy sources back Elon Musk's 'white genocide' claim in South Africa.

The New Critics, he argues, developed close reading less to disseminate conservative nostalgia for preindustrial organicism and more to shore up the cultural capital of a university education in literary study during a time of mass literacy with a technique designed to analyze particularly difficult literary texts, especially those of the high modernists and the metaphysical poets. Knowing how to close-read became an expression of one’s training in higher education, a relatively rare form of reading that endows one with a high level of cultural capital. from Pay Attention!

(https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/05/10/iceland-approved-the-4-day-workweek-in-2019-nearly-6-years-later-all-the-predictions-made-have-come-true/) - ""In 2019, Iceland made headlines by becoming one of the first countries in the world to adopt the four-day working week, not through a general law, but through agreements allowing workers to negotiate shorter weeks or reduced hours. Five years on, the results are indisputable.""[ 1 (https://dannyreviews.com/h/Sagas_Icelanders.html) , 2 (https://www.metafilter.com/146928/USA-vs-Scandinavia#5932722) , 3 (https://web.archive.org/web/20081107203753/http://i36.tinypic.com/2qs8m4z.jpg) ] The Icelandic experiment began in 2015 with a pilot phase involving around 2,500 employees, or just over 1% of the country’s working population. Following the resounding success of this initiative, with 86% of the employees involved expressing their support, the project was made official in 2019 . Today, almost 90% of Icelandic workers benefit from a reduced working week of 36 hours, compared with 40 hours previously, with no loss of pay. Initial concerns about the four-day week were widespread, both in Iceland and elsewhere in the world. There were fears of a drop in productivity, increased costs for businesses and difficulties in adapting to maintain service levels. However, the Icelandic experience has swept these fears under the carpet. though not quite 4 days/week, how iceland 'right-sized' its workweek... The Icelandic experience of work (https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/15/iceland-adopted-the-four-day-workweek-starting-in-2019-and-more-than-five-years-later-its-confirmed-gen-z-was-right-all-along/) - ""This far-reaching transformation was not brought about by a single government decree, but through collective bargaining and the strength of trade union agreements. The latter have made it possible to introduce considerable flexibility: employees can either reduce the number of hours they work per week, or opt for a working week condensed into fewer days. This pragmatism has been the key to successful mass adoption."" Several factors explain why the Icelandic model has worked so well where other initiatives have stalled. Firstly, and crucially, the transition was made without any loss of pay or reduction in benefits for employees. This is a major difference from models such as the one tried out in Belgium, where the four-day week often has to be compensated for by longer working days. Secondly, Iceland has invested massively in digitalising its businesses and public services. The country has one of the most advanced internet infrastructures in the world, with fast, reliable connections, even in rural areas. This technological environment has made it much easier to maintain productivity, particularly by encouraging the growth of remote working and process optimisation. Finally, this transition has had collateral benefits for society. For example, gender equality has been promoted, with men having more free time and being more inclined to invest in household and family tasks. The Icelandic experience, five years in the making, offers a fascinating perspective on the future of work. It shows that a reduction in working time, far from being a utopian dream, can be a winning strategy for productivity, employee well-being and even social equality. By preparing the ground with an education that is already highly digitised, Iceland is ensuring a smoother adaptation for future generations of workers. This open-air social laboratory confirms, through facts, that the intuitions and demands of Generation Z concerning a healthier work/life balance and a redefinition of performance are not mere whims, but perhaps the foundations of a more sustainable and humane working model.[ 4 (https://www.metafilter.com/208776/I-cleaned-yer-boots-Ill-go-get-em-fer-ya#8723197) ] Iceland's shorter working week has been a huge success – and it's changed my family's life (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/21/iceland-36-hour-working-week-stress-job) - ""For 90% of working Icelanders, a 36-hour week means less stress, more job satisfaction and time to enjoy life beyond work."" Tumi, my husband, works in a government office. At first, he chose to work until noon every Friday but soon decided instead to have two full Fridays off each month.

Moreover, he is home in time to pick up our son from school at 13.40. Since I collect our son the other days, this gives me the freedom every other Friday afternoon to meet friends for a chat, volunteer, or simply to go to the swimming pool alone, which is an absolute gamechanger for a tired teacher who wants to escape burnout.

What’s happening:  Australians will be electing 150 members of the House of Representatives (the lower house, where government is formed), and 40 of the 76 Senate (upper house) seats will be contested. Political Background:  The incumbent centre-left Labor Government led by PM Anthony Albanese is seeking re-election for a second term.  It is being challenged by the conservative Liberal/National coalition led by Opposition Leader Peter Dutton.  The previous election in 2022 saw a significant number of minor party and independents elected, and many analysts consider a hung parliament a reasonable possibility in 2025. Voting in Australia:  Voting is compulsory for all citizens over the age of 18 – non-voters receive a small fine, but culturally ‘everyone votes’, particularly as Federal elections are managed by the independent Australian Electoral Commission (https://www.aec.gov.au/media/2025/index.htm) which is strongly oriented towards maximising the number of people voting, including through extensive early voting options.  Around 40-45% of votes are cast in the fortnight before election day, although many Australians hold off until election day to vote at their local school and pick up a prized ‘ democracy sausage (https://democracysausage.org/about) ’.

 (https://live.australiainstitute.org.au/) The Count:  Given the ongoing drift away of voters from the major parties, there is a good chance Saturday night’s count won’t finish at 10pm AEST with a new or returned government, either due to close counts in key seats, or neither major party gaining enough seats to form government, and instead having to begin negotiations with minor parties and independents.  Most importantly - the face of elections in Australia, the ABC’s Antony Green, is retiring as an on-air analyst (https://antonygreen.com.au/why-ive-decided-to-retire-from-presenting-elections-plus-a-few-words-of-thank-you/) after 36 years.

Her announcements reflected an agenda both ambitious in scale and comprehensive in scope: sixteen new laws and twelve constitutional reforms ranging from the recognition of Indigenous peoples and the real increase in the minimum wage, to the recovery of Mexico's national ownership of natural resources and a crackdown on tax evasion. 'Let it be heard loud and clear,' Sheinbaum said (https://www-gob-mx.translate.goog/presidencia/articulos/version-estenografica-informe-100-dias-de-gobierno?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp) . 'We will not return to the neoliberal model ... We will continue with Mexican Humanism and with the maxim of 'For the good of all, first the poor.''"" ( via (https://zirk.us/@interfluidity/114285969029908058) ) At the time of AMLO’s inauguration in 2018, the presidency, political parties, and local governments recorded the lowest levels of citizen trust in the country’s modern history. Eighty-five percent of the population expressed no trust at all in the president, 84 percent had no trust in political parties, 81 percent distrusted their state government, and 77 percent their municipal government. Federal legislators fared little better: 62 percent of citizens disapproved of their deputies, and 60 percent of their senators. Faith in the judicial system, meanwhile, had eroded through both the quotidian experience of its dysfunction and a series of high-profile scandals; the previous government of Enrique Peña Nieto, for example, spied on its citizens with Pegasus technology, and fired the prosecutor tasked with investigating sources of illicit financing for his presidential campaign... In the span of just six years, AMLO’s policies succeeded in restoring the public’s faith in a once-failed state. By 2023, 54 percent of Mexicans had high or moderately high trust in the federal government, a figure significantly higher than that of its OECD partners, which averaged just 39 percent. This has often been dismissed, particularly in the pages of the US’s business press, as the result of mere populism—a superficial appeal to mass anti-elitism in service of the consolidation of power. But for its militants, the Fourth Transformation is a “national popular” project. Though aided at times by symbolic gestures and public theatrics, its foundational strategy is the forging of a durable coalition to carry out a truly transformative program. This has meant not only firing up the masses, but also drawing in other poderes fácticos , from the country’s industrial elites to its armed forces, toward a mutually beneficial vision of national development. Morena (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morena_(political_party)#cite_ref-7) : ""MORENA describes itself as a democratic left-wing party that supports ethnic, religious, cultural, and sexual diversity, respect for human rights, and environmental care. It describes itself as an opponent of the neoliberal economic policies that Mexico began adopting in the 1980s. MORENA states that a new economic model is needed after the failures of neoliberalism in Mexico, which has resulted in increased corruption and inequality."" * (https://www.metafilter.com/206240/Their-echo-chamber-doubles-as-this-countrys-largest-media-networks#8648165)","['https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-fourth-transformation/', 'https://www-gob-mx.translate.goog/presidencia/articulos/version-estenografica-informe-100-dias-de-gobierno?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp', 'https://zirk.us/@interfluidity/114285969029908058', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morena_(political_party)#cite_ref-7', 'https://www.metafilter.com/206240/Their-echo-chamber-doubles-as-this-countrys-largest-media-networks#8648165']",metafilter

Joe Patrice: While it is true that many of the TdA members removed under the AEA do not have criminal records in the United States, that is because they have only been in the United States for a short period of time. The lack of a criminal record does not indicate they pose a limited threat. In fact, based upon their association with TdA, the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose. It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile. That’s from the declaration of ICE Field Officer Robert Cerna claiming that their complete lack of any evidence is actually a PLUS because “the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose.” Esteemed members of the jury, we have no motive or opportunity or physical evidence tying the defendant to the crime. But — in a sense — doesn’t it prove how good he was at covering it up? We already know that several of these deported individuals had no apparent gang ties beyond “having tattoos,” (https://xcancel.com/ReichlinMelnick/status/1901837832068493804) which should concern everyone but especially America’s goth girls. It should go without saying that the government shouldn’t imprison people — here or abroad — without any evidence of criminality. If the government thinks a non-criminal migrant presents a threat then they can kick them out of the country but they cannot unilaterally decide that their untested suspicions justify prison time in another country.","['https://abovethelaw.com/2025/03/trump-admin-unveils-new-legal-standard-we-have-no-proof-which-actually-proves-our-case/', 'https://xcancel.com/ReichlinMelnick/status/1901837832068493804']",metafilter

In his message on Thursday, Ocalan said the armed struggle had ""run its course"", though he also urged Turkey to show respect for ethnic minorities, freedom of expression and the right to democratic self-organisation. The pro-Kurdish political movement, the target of a years-long judicial crackdown, will hope Ocalan's move helps usher in democratic reforms and cultural and language rights in Turkey. For Ankara, a peace deal would relieve a burden on its security forces, ease social tensions and boost the mainly Kurdish southeast's under-developed economy. Jailed Kurdish leader calls for PKK to disarm – in shift that could shake up Turkey and Middle East (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/27/pkk-leader-calls-on-kurdish-militant-group-to-disarm-signalling-start-of-fragile-peace-with-turkey) - ""The ageing leader of a Kurdish militant group imprisoned on a remote Turkish island has called on the group to disarm and dissolve itself, opening the door to a fragile peace with Turkey after four decades of guerrilla warfare, attacks and reprisals... Öcalan's message will have far-reaching implications across the Middle East, not least in Syria where Kurdish forces control significant territory, but also in Iran and Iraq."" “I am making a call for the laying down of arms, and I take on the historical responsibility for this call,” Öcalan was quoted as saying. “All groups must lay down their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself.” [...] The 75-year-old is serving a life sentence at an island prison south of Istanbul, after being captured by Turkish special forces in Kenya in 1999... His message was greeted with joy in the Istanbul conference room where Öcalan’s allies gathered to broadcast his call, after displaying a photo of supporters visiting the white-haired septuagenarian. A group of older Kurdish peace activists ululated as the call to lay down arms was read out. [...] Rumours of a declaration have rumbled for months while the DEM party shuttled between different Kurdish factions and Öcalan’s island prison for negotiations. How the different factions within the PKK might respond to Öcalan’s call also remained opaque. The head of the Syrian branch of the PKK told Al Arabiya that disarmament must be accompanied by the group being “allowed to work politically”. “If the reasons for carrying weapons disappear, we will lay them down,” he said, adding that Turkish attacks necessitated the group carrying weapons. The group would consult among themselves about how to implement Öcalan’s call, he said. Earlier this month, one PKK commander told a television channel close to the faction that much of the group would only regard the command as serious if Öcalan demanded they disarm after walking free from prison. “This work cannot be done only through a call,” he said. “We are a movement with tens of thousands of armed people. These fighters are not on a payroll to be sacked. These are ideological fighters.” Öcalan, he said, “has to speak while free. If not, how can [PKK militants] be convinced to lay down their arms?” Jailed Kurdish Militant Leader Calls on Followers to Disarm, End 40-Year Conflict With Turkey (https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/imprisoned-kurdish-militant-leader-calls-on-followers-to-disarm-after-40-years-of-conflict/ar-AA1zVbDe) - ""The group initially fought for an independent Kurdish state and later demanded greater rights for Kurds, a broad ethnic group of tens of millions of people spread across Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. The PKK has affiliates in all four countries."" The path to resolving the conflict remains uncertain, with no clear plan in place for a peace process and thousands of PKK-affiliated fighters spread across the region. Much will depend on how Erdogan and the Turkish government choose to respond to Öcalan’s message and whether Kurdish militants comply with the call to disarm. Thousands of battle-hardened Kurdish fighters across the region would have to be demobilized. Key leaders of PKK affiliates in the region, including a political party linked to the group in Syria, have said in recent weeks they would comply with Öcalan’s message. It is also not clear what, if anything, Turkey has offered in return for the PKK laying down their arms. The Turkish government could free Öcalan or other Kurdish leaders from prison as a part of a possible future deal, analysts say.

Their fate will remake the region (https://unherd.com/2025/02/can-kurds-survive-the-new-syria/) Welcome, then, to the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), a place that sometimes feels at the very edge of world affairs. Save the Catalan Parliament, no foreign body recognises this multi-ethnic federation of four million people, often known by its Kurdish name Rojava. And yet this rugged corner of the Middle East, between the Euphrates and the Tigris, has long been a fulcrum of regional change. The Assyrians and Seleucids and Ottomans have all come and gone, leaving locals deeply conscious of their storied history. One group of AANES-affiliated Arab women’s activists have named themselves “Zenobia” — evoking the ancient warrior queen who briefly defied Rome here back in the 3rd century. These days, AANES faces threats equal to Aurelian’s legions. After the dramatic collapse of the Assad regime, Damascus is ruled by Ahmed al-Sharaa, and his al-Qaeda offshoot Hayyat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Turkey, HTS’s key backer, lurks behind the border wall, its drones leaving vapour trails spiralling through the sky as they target AANES ambulances, civilian protesters and Kurdish commanders continuing the fight against ISIS. And then there is the Islamic State itself, no longer a physical Caliphate but still backed by tens of thousands of fanatical detainees, currently wallowing in AANES-run camps but eager for revenge. With Donald Trump still prevaricating over Washington’s role in the region, the future feels bewilderingly unclear. Nor is this surprising. AANES’s existential struggles for survival have long been animated by dynamics driving the broader conflict now engulfing the Middle East — proxy conflict amid a new Cold War; Islamist insurgency and authoritarian brutality; struggles over oil and water resources between rich capitals and impoverished regions. All the while, the AANES’s vision of multi-ethnic federation governance offers a striking alternative to Islamism and autocracy, even as its fate hints at the future course of conflicts swirling through Syria, the Levant, and beyond... The AANES has shown some openness to local sensitivities. Though the diplomatic and military elite is still dominated by Kurds, Raqqa and other Arab areas have been able to secure exemptions in areas like secular education, military service, oil tariffs and marriage law. Public opinion in Raqqa is therefore more nuanced than either the AANES or its opponents suggest. By defending the rule of law and protecting basic services even in Arab regions — visiting for the first time in three years, I was struck by the pace of reconstruction in Raqqa’s bustling market — officials have long been able to secure tacit support from locals otherwise suspicious of its modernising, feminist vision. “Despite all the errors AANES has made, it is nonetheless the best option in Syria,” a female Arab journalist in Raqqa tells me, sipping a fruit milkshake from a nearby store. “I personally would like to see the AANES and HTS reach a deal for a shared administration.” Syria’s leaders have tried to find some common ground. Al-Sharaa has already met the top Syrian Kurdish commander, while HTS and AANES have maintained a careful ceasefire, with both sides expressing sincere desires to prevent further conflict and establish working committees and a national conference. But Turkey’s massive influence as al-Sharaa’s key foreign interlocutor is frustrating progress, while both sides have deeply contrasting visions about what Syria should look like: secular versus clerical; federal versus unitary... Assessing these panicked appeals, a Syrian Kurdish friend describes his stateless people as “children who grew up without parents, leaving them desperate for love from anyone.” Indeed, the Syrian Kurds have long sought support in unexpected places. On the one hand, the AANES has drawn support from the international Left by advancing its progressive ideology through the “anti-fascist” struggle against ISIS. On the other, the AANES’s armed wing successfully established themselves as the Pentagon’s indispensable partner in the war against Islamist terror. Even beyond emotive appeals to anti-fascist values, or else the security risk posed by over 40,000 ISIS affiliates still held in the region, yearning for a HTS takeover, there are reasons for observers of all stripes to care about what happens next. When appealing to its anarchist and socialist supporters, the AANES has long drawn comparisons to the Spanish Civil War. The analogy is more than a rhetorical flourish. Just like in Spain, the Syrian bloodbath presaged a far wider conflict, one defined by proxy warfare, state collapse and mass displacement. The conflict offers a case-study for the coming disintegration of the so-called “rules-based international system” — a euphemism for US hegemony — as Islamism and other forms of political militancy both challenge and buttress central state power. All this is precipitated by rising temperatures, desertification, failed harvests, and the weaponisation of water resources. Israel’s degradation of Iran’s clients in Hezbollah and Hamas forms part of this broader story, paving the way for Assad’s collapse. Turkey’s expansion of drone and proxy warfare beyond Syria into Iraq, Azerbaijan and Libya does too. The mooted economic corridor linking Saudi Arabia through Israel to Europe, while evading Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, will be linked to fresh conflicts, as will Turkey’s competing, multi-billion dollar Development Road project between Baghdad and the West. Combined with worsening resource competition in the Eastern Mediterranean and Horn of Africa, little wonder that AANES representatives have long referred to this spiralling polycrisis by a simpler name: World War III. The complex struggles in northern Syria therefore form part of a broader picture, suggesting ways in which state governance, resistance and reaction might evolve in decades to come. For all their differences, the AANES and HTS have responded to these historical upheavals in strikingly similar ways. “HTS have two faces,” says one opposition activist in Raqqa. “One is a religious face, which aims to export jihad worldwide; and the other is a political one, which tries to find a solution for all the peoples in Syria. We are with them for this second approach.” The AANES, which has long sought to balance radical Leftist militancy and institutionalised legitimacy, could be described in similar terms. Evolving far beyond its utopian vision of a decentralised “commune of communes”, it’s established a complex federation capable of feeding and protecting millions of people despite severe ideological differences. Indeed, while AANES officials dramatically claim that “Turkey wants to reorganise Syrian society under an Ottoman vilayet system”, their own project rather closely resembles that unwieldy pre-modern federation. Given this mutual pragmatism, it’s possible to at least imagine a future modus vivendi between HTS and the AANES. While the latter have declared their readiness to recognise al-Sharaa, and integrate into his new Syrian army, any such transition is likely to be fraught and protracted. Rather, the Kurdish leadership will seek ways to survive, adapting themselves to a diminished role in the new Syria. Their chances depend on the direction taken in Damascus. Al-Sharaa himself looks set to continue down the path of technocratic crony capitalism, coupled with authoritarian repression of civil society. It’s a model he has already successfully trialled in Idlib, while the new Syrian foreign minister recently joined Tony Blair on stage at Davos to proclaim his hopes that his country would follow the Saudi Arabian path toward neoliberal integration. While this model could protect some basic rights, community self-determination in the Kurdish model is likely to remain beyond the pale. Nonetheless, it’s striking to hear AANES talking-points over women’s and minority rights being echoed by both al-Sharaa and the conservative Arab opposition in Raqqa. From 1789 to 1917, all true revolutions have had an impact beyond their collapse, as civil rights once seen as radical become everyday conventions.

Mightn’t everything be better if visionary engineers had their way, replacing all the messy, squalid compromises of politics with radical innovation and purpose-engineered efficient systems?

When the book, originally published in 1997, was reissued in 2020, Thiel wrote the preface (https://archive.ph/o2qfC) . Under this simplifying grand narrative, the federal state was at best another inefficient industry that was ripe for disruption. At worst, national government and representative democracy were impediments that needed to be swept away, as Davidson and Rees-Mogg had argued. From there, it’s only a hop, skip and a jump to even more extreme ideas that, while not formally in the canon, have come to define the tech right. In 2013, Balaji Srinivasan, a homegrown intellectual and entrepreneur, gave a Y Combinator speech arguing that Silicon Valley had to escape or subvert the control of the East Coast “Paper Belt,” which deployed government bureaucracy to stifle innovation. He was quickly offered a job by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The neo-reactionary Curtis Yarvin argued that all government employees should be “retired” and entrepreneurs should become monarchs. Yarvin was plucked from blogging obscurity by Thiel and is now interviewed by publications like the New York Times (https://archive.ph/UPRmU) and cited as an influence by JD Vance (https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24266512/jd-vance-curtis-yarvin-influence-rage-project-2025) .

From Scott’s broader perspective, AI is not a solution, but a swift way to make the problem worse. It will replace the gross simplifications of bureaucracy with incomprehensible abstractions that have been filtered through the “ hidden layers (http://bactra.org/weblog/shoggothim.html) ”[ 5 (https://www.metafilter.com/200847/Separating-hyperplanes-with-Shoggoth-Shalmaneser) ] of artificial neurons that allow it to work. DOGE’s artificial-intelligence-fueled vision of government is a vision from Franz Kafka, not Friedrich Hayek. DOGE’s attempt to remake government in the image of Silicon Valley will not be the apotheosis of the engineering ideal that Musk hopes for. Even some sympathetic Silicon Valley elites, including Graham, are visibly nervous (https://archive.ph/iRAAx) that it will end in calamity. It may become an object lesson in the importance of all the questions that should be asked by the canon but are not. Canons create miniature universes of discourse, which emphasize some values and choices while de-emphasizing or even concealing others. So what does the Silicon Valley canon sideline or leave out? In short, a respect for pluralism (https://www.plurality.net/) [ 6 (https://www.metafilter.com/207369/Our-Cyber-Solar-Punk-Future) ] and a suspicion of grand projects, both of which used to be quite common among technologists.

Palantir's Call to Arms Is Also a Sales Pitch (https://www.yahoo.com/news/palantir-call-arms-sales-pitch-110014562.html) - "" The Technological Republic , a new book from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, proposes a dark and dismal future."" It’s a major complaint of the authors of The Technological Republic (Crown Currency, Feb. 18) that people today shrink from saying what they think. Too many of us, they insist, give mealy-mouthed, wishy-washy answers when asked. We have become uncomfortable with making moral and aesthetic judgments, they say. I agree, and I’m going to break the taboos. The Technological Republic is a terrible book: badly written, tedious, and — when they can be gleaned in between the jargon, clichés and repetitions — full of bad ideas, ranging from the merely dubious to the execrable and disturbing. This book is dismal on the level of both form and content. It heralds a dark and depressing future. also btw... How humanity lost control (https://www.zawya.com/en/news/insights/how-humanity-lost-control-rge0u40k) - ""The guru who made the most progress in building management cybernetics was the counterculture-era management consultant Stafford Beer, whose book Brain of the Firm explored how bureaucracies can be reformed so that the internal flow of information between deciders and decided-upon is kept in balance. Without that, a system will not remain viable and useful to humanity over time.""[ 8 (https://www.metafilter.com/205469/The-World-Were-Designing#8624292) , 9 (https://www.metafilter.com/204502/The-private-pathology-of-the-public-philosophy#8587282) ] How can we be at least 15 times richer than our pre-industrial Agrarian Age predecessors, and yet so unhappy? One explanation is that we are not wired for it: nothing in our heritage or evolutionary past prepared us to deal with a society of more than 150 people. To operate our increasingly complex technologies and advance our prosperity, we somehow must coordinate among more than eight billion people. We therefore have built massive societal machines comprising market economies, government and corporate bureaucracies, national and sub-national polities, cultural ideologies, and more. Yet we struggle to fine-tune these institutions, because we simply do not understand them. We are left with a globe-spanning network of profoundly alien leviathans that boss us around and make us unhappy, even as they make us fabulously rich compared to previous generations. ...the best way to reform organizations so that they do not become unaccountability machines is to revive the post-World War II quasi-discipline of management cybernetics. Pioneered by the computer scientist Norbert Wiener and the political scientist Herbert Simon, the approach was named for the Greek word kybernētikos: “good at steering a boat.” The guru who made the most progress in building management cybernetics was the counterculture-era management consultant Stafford Beer, whose book Brain of the Firm explored how bureaucracies can be reformed so that the internal flow of information between deciders and decided-upon is kept in balance. Without that, a system will not remain viable and useful to humanity over time. Reviewing The Unaccountability Machine in the Financial Times, Felix Martin describes Davies’ approach as “a kind of psychoanalysis for non-human intelligences, with Stafford Beer as Sigmund Freud.” I could not have said it better. Our social world is no longer confined to our families, our neighbors, our co-workers, and those with whom we directly interact via networks of affection, antipathy, barter and exchange, small-scale planning, and arm-twisting. Instead, more and more of what we do is driven by an extremely complex assembly of vast interlocking social and technological mechanisms that we have made but do not understand. If the challenge of modernity is to figure out a better way to work and think together as a global community of more than eight billion people, how can we improve our understanding, and thus our control? --- * previously (https://ask.metafilter.com/297591/Origin-of-the-term-Engineers-Disease) :P","['https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/to-understand-doge-look-to-the-tech-industry-s-reading-list', 'https://archive.ph/4fBYc', 'https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/sovereign-nonsense/', 'https://www.metafilter.com/195711/The-Sunflower-Movements-Useful-Fictions-and-Consensus-Reality', 'https://archive.ph/o2qfC', 'https://archive.ph/UPRmU', 'https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24266512/jd-vance-curtis-yarvin-influence-rage-project-2025', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20020123030550/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/Reviews/Seeing_Like_a_State.html', 'https://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2010/01/high-modernism-and-expert-knowledge.html', 'https://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2010/02/scotts-social-imagination.html', 'https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/11/shaping-the-world/', 'http://bactra.org/weblog/shoggothim.html', 'https://www.metafilter.com/200847/Separating-hyperplanes-with-Shoggoth-Shalmaneser', 'https://archive.ph/iRAAx', 'https://www.plurality.net/', 'https://www.metafilter.com/207369/Our-Cyber-Solar-Punk-Future', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcSil8NeQq8', 'https://www.metafilter.com/207699/Getting-to-Denmark-looks-further-away-than-ever-vs-annexing-Greenland#8688840', 'https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/02/elon-musk-donald-trump-federal-workers-project-2025.html', 'https://archive.ph/nzILq', 'https://theconversation.com/trumps-project-2025-agenda-caps-decades-long-resistance-to-20th-century-progressive-reform-247176', 'https://time.com/5888024/50-trillion-income-inequality-america/', 'https://www.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/WRA516-1.html', 'https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2025/02/the-top-10/', 'https://archive.ph/iU59O', 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/palantir-call-arms-sales-pitch-110014562.html', 'https://www.zawya.com/en/news/insights/how-humanity-lost-control-rge0u40k', 'https://www.metafilter.com/205469/The-World-Were-Designing#8624292', 'https://www.metafilter.com/204502/The-private-pathology-of-the-public-philosophy#8587282', 'https://ask.metafilter.com/297591/Origin-of-the-term-Engineers-Disease']",metafilter

The Trump administration has long focused (/206296/And-ya-know-getting-them-out-will-be-a-bloody-story) on relocating immigrants and American prisoners (https://www.opb.org/article/2025/02/04/trump-says-he-s-exploring-option-to-send-jailed-us-criminals-to-other-countries/) into domestic and international concentration camps and prisons (https://lite.cnn.com/2025/02/03/americas/el-salvador-migrant-deal-marco-rubio-intl-hnk/index.html) , but now they are looking to expand it to much wider swath of American citizens with a variety of medical conditions, as well as African American children.

Round up people with mental health conditions in camps (https://www.salon.com/2025/02/19/rfk-s-plan-to-make-america-healthy-again-round-up-people-with-mental-health-conditions-in-camps/) Robert F. Kennedy wants to replace standard psychological care with unpaid labor on ""wellness farms"" Instead of letting people have drugs that keep them healthy, Kennedy's ""solution"" looks very much like punishing them for perceived personal failures by putting people into labor camps, which he euphemistically calls ""wellness farms."" As Mother Jones reported in July (https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/rfk-jr-wants-to-send-people-on-antidepressants-to-government-wellness-farms/) , people would be relegated to these ""farms,"" where they would be denied their prescription medications. They would also be barred from having cell phones, computers, or other means to contact the outside world. They would be put to work full-time, presumably for little or no pay, growing organic food. He claims this process would ""reparent"" supposedly broken people, again framing mental health issues as not a medical issue, but a personal failure. The racism underlying this vision of labor camps isn't just vibes, either. Kennedy has explicitly argued that Black kids (https://xcancel.com/American_Bridge/status/1816514317950271678) need to ""get reparented,"" ideally in a ""rural area"" where they are denied most contact with family and friends. ""Treating"" Black youth by making them do unpaid agricultural work isn't exactly subtle, as far as racist fantasies go. Donald Trump’s Next Diversity Target: People With Disabilities (https://www.thenation.com/article/society/trump-dei-target-access-disabilities/) The president’s disdain for disabled people—and obsession with genetic superiority—harks back to a grim past. One month into his presidency, Trump has unleashed a government-wide attack on people with disabilities, from anti-diversity executive orders to proposed special-education rollbacks to threats to slash programs like Medicaid that are lifelines for disabled people across the country. If successful, these actions could have catastrophic consequences for millions of Americans, according to disability rights experts. ... The Trump administration’s assault on government policies and programs that benefit disabled people is not just a scheme hatched in the bowels of The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 anti-government boiler room—although it is that, too. It’s also the natural evolution of Trump’s long-standing prejudice against people with disabilities. Trump’s disdain for disabled people is well known, from mocking (https://apnews.com/united-states-presidential-election-general-news-events-08876797f35e48da8597e97976a67d8a) reporter Serge Kovaleski and insulting (https://www.federaltimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2023/10/03/trump-insulted-vets-in-private-former-chief-of-staff-kelly-confirms/) wounded veterans to reportedly telling (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/donald-trump-nephew-book-fred-trump.html) a relative with a disabled son that “maybe those kinds of people should just die.” How to pay for these farms? Kennedy had an answer. With money generated through a sales tax on cannabis products, Kennedy said, “I’m going to dedicate that revenue to creating wellness farms—drug rehabilitation farms, in rural areas all over this country,” he said. (https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/rfk-jr-wants-to-send-people-on-antidepressants-to-government-wellness-farms/) Other possibilities could include selling the organic produce and results of the free labor, and raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion dollars (https://apnews.com/article/house-republicans-budget-blueprint-trump-tax-cuts-ff2bddf31f4e7cb0928139072392a091) or  reallocate other governement funds could be a start.","['https://www.salon.com/2025/02/19/rfk-s-plan-to-make-america-healthy-again-round-up-people-with-mental-health-conditions-in-camps/', 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/how-rfk-jr-wants-help-treat-addiction-wellness-farms', '/206296/And-ya-know-getting-them-out-will-be-a-bloody-story', 'https://www.opb.org/article/2025/02/04/trump-says-he-s-exploring-option-to-send-jailed-us-criminals-to-other-countries/', 'https://lite.cnn.com/2025/02/03/americas/el-salvador-migrant-deal-marco-rubio-intl-hnk/index.html', 'https://www.salon.com/2025/02/19/rfk-s-plan-to-make-america-healthy-again-round-up-people-with-mental-health-conditions-in-camps/', 'https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/rfk-jr-wants-to-send-people-on-antidepressants-to-government-wellness-farms/', 'https://xcancel.com/American_Bridge/status/1816514317950271678', 'https://www.thenation.com/article/society/trump-dei-target-access-disabilities/', 'https://apnews.com/united-states-presidential-election-general-news-events-08876797f35e48da8597e97976a67d8a', 'https://www.federaltimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2023/10/03/trump-insulted-vets-in-private-former-chief-of-staff-kelly-confirms/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/donald-trump-nephew-book-fred-trump.html', 'https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/rfk-jr-wants-to-send-people-on-antidepressants-to-government-wellness-farms/', 'https://apnews.com/article/house-republicans-budget-blueprint-trump-tax-cuts-ff2bddf31f4e7cb0928139072392a091']",metafilter

He says a dictator is basically just like a corporate CEO. They're all dictators in their businesses and so we need a dictator that is the corporation that's the United States of America... Donald Trump has taken the position that his scholars call the "" unitary executive (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljo3FL8uyIg) "" position which is that anything that is under the executive branch of government writ broadly, including the independent boards and agencies are not really independent but are rather subordinate and vertically reporting to the president so the president can fire any of them for any reason -- for political reasons, for reasons of retaliation -- and Congress cannot stand in the way with a statute which says, ""no this is a six-year term"" or ""this is a four-year term that has gone into your administration."" We learned last night -- this is really an historic and dreadful statement -- but the Department of Justice said they no longer will defend these statutes. So people are going to start to feel the consequences of this outrageous, monarchical and ideological assault on the laws of the people, the programs of the people, right? That's what government is. In a democratic society, government is just us, and the people we pay relatively low wages to go and do our work. What's the job of the president? Is it to be a king? Is it to be a monarch?

No. The core job of the president in Article Two is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. Take the laws that Congress has passed and implement them. That's the job of the president.

If what Trump has done is upheld as legal or becomes a norm, other global leaders have every incentive to do what he did, turning democratic governance into corporate governance.

We should therefore ask: what's so good about democracy?"" None of this is an argument against democracy. Churchill was right: it is ""the worst form of government, except for all the others."" Instead, it's an argument for rethinking how democratic ideals should be implemented. Henry Farrell is dead right (https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/were-getting-the-social-media-crisis) : ""what we need are better collective means of thinking.""[ 7 (https://www.metafilter.com/207369/Our-Cyber-Solar-Punk-Future) ] We need more institutional (https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2021/04/the-need-for-institutional-brains.html) brains, as we might acquire - for example - from forms (https://www.thersa.org/projects/deliberative-democracy) of deliberative (https://www.amacad.org/publication/daedalus/twelve-key-findings-deliberative-democracy-research) democracy (https://www.sscc.wisc.edu/soc/faculty/pages/wright/deliberative.html) . Almost no mainstream politician or pundit is even asking how to do this. Why not? Part of the answer lies in the fact that ideas are shaped (https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2021/04/on-generational-difference.html) in our formative years: as Napoleon said, “to understand the man you have to know what was happening in the world when he was twenty.” And in the formation of those of us over 50, western politicians saw democracy as a self-evidently good thing; it was contrasted to the ""evil Empire"" of the Soviet bloc. And so capitalism and democracy were conflated in the public mind. But this was an unhappy alliance because, as Jean Batou says (https://jacobin.com/2025/01/capitalism-democratic-freedoms-popular-struggle) , there has always been a tension between the two. Yes, capitalism needs democracy because popular consent, even if partial and ill-informed, helps legitimate inequality. But on the other hand, the power of the rich - even when they are not drug-addled neo-nazis - undermines the virtues of democracy. And this is becoming obvious to voters: a survey (https://fairnessfoundation.com/inequality-knocks) by the Fairness Foundation found that 63% of Britons think that the very rich have too much influence. For now, this opinion is latent and largely unarticulated except on the margins of political discourse. But it poses questions: can we build a better (https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2024/12/repairing-the-public-sphere.html) [ 8 (https://www.metafilter.com/206746/The-Oligarchy-Is-Coming-How-to-Repair-the-Public-Sphere) ] democracy without challenging actually-existing capitalism?

Who is likely to be the better probation officer: the one drawn to the profession by a desire to rehabilitate offenders; or one who will earn a little more for hitting a contractual target? Who is likely to better look after vulnerable children: someone attracted to work in childrens' homes by a love of children; or one working for a profit-maximizing private equity firm? If the cash nexus comes to dominate, other motives such as professional pride recede not just because people change but because those with strong professional ethics simply leave the job. Which brings us to a problem. Markets are not merely a value-free technology, to be used or not depending upon the precise job in hand. They also have an ethical dimension. In Spheres of Justice Michael Walzer argues that there are some things which money should not be able to buy, because to do so would violate the very meaning of them: criminal justice; divine grace; political rights such as to vote and free speech; and so on. The Beatles were right: ""money can't buy me love"", even if it can get you some of its correlates. In this spirit, the buying of political influence via lobbyists and party donors is simply wrong; it denies what democracy is. Allocative efficiency is not the only value. Another argument for limiting markets comes from those with environmental or aesthetic motives, or those wanting to restrict the domain in which capitalism operates. Patrick Grant urges (https://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/stock/less-stop-buying-so-much-rubbish-how-having-fewer-better-things-can-make-us-happier-patrick-grant) us to buy less disposable clothing from companies like Shein and fewer but better items. Jason Hickel proposes (https://www.jasonhickel.org/less-is-more) measures to reduce advertising and planned obsolescence. And in everyday activities such as allotments, repair cafes or early retirement people are reducing the realm of market activity. Colin Leys, echoing Marx, has shown how capitalism tries to expand (https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/commodification-essence-of-our-time/) markets in order to raise profits - but there is a backlash to this... On the other hand, though, the government seems keen on markets where it shouldn't be. It's showing little enthusiasm for ending the subcontracting of public services, or for stopping the sale of political influence. It is permitting a sham market in water, which is merely a front (https://leftfootforward.org/2025/02/the-water-industry-shows-how-the-state-indulges-corporations-to-the-detriment-of-society/) for theft.

What's more, it is doing nothing to promote decommodification. It has dropped the Corbynite interest in universal (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/igp/publications/2022/feb/social-prosperity-future-proposal-universal-basic-services-2017) basic services (https://www.labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12730_19-Universal-Basic-Services_v5.pdf) (pdf), for example, and its desire to expand Heathrow and cajole the unwell into work is a sign of a desire to simply expand economic activity at all costs. This, however, is one of the drawbacks of social democracy: the need for tax revenue and to retain the cooperation of capitalists conflicts with the need to reverse commodification, be it on grounds of environmentalism, efficiency or ethics. What the left can learn from Richard II (https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2025/01/what-the-left-can-learn-from-richard-ii.html) - ""I've a feeling we're not in The West Wing any more.

What matters is the building of groups of supporters, and the weakening of potential rivals. And once one has a growing band of supporters, there'll be a bandwagon effect as others jump onto the winning side: Shakespeare's Duke of York joining Bolingbroke's cause prefigured American newspaper bosses aligning with Trump… Marx - a great reader (https://www.counterfire.org/article/marx-s-shakespeare/) of Shakespeare (https://blogs.bl.uk/european/2016/05/the-shakespearomania-of-karl-marx.html) - thought that emergent trends within capitalism would, from a socialist point of view, do the gardener's job. A decline in the numbers of petit bourgeois, he thought, would ""wound the bark"" by weakening a class hostile to socialism, whilst a growing working class would strengthen the ""bearing boughs"" that support socialism. He was too optimistic. Coalitions of interests don't just emerge. They must be created. It's in this context that policy matters. It is not merely a matter of technocratic fixes or hawking product (https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2019/03/against-retail-politics.html) like market traders, but a way of creating or weakening alliances... Here, we see another failure of the Democrats, pointed out by Dani Rodrik. Bidenomics, he says (https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/democrats-biden-wrong-kind-of-economic-populism-by-dani-rodrik-2024-12) ""paid too little attention to the changing structure of the economy and the nature of the new working class"". In not doing enough to offer service sector workers good jobs, it did not sufficiently cultivate the ""bearing boughs"" that could be a wide working class base… Unless he can offer better public services, more affordable housing and better jobs, the answer might well be: not enough. Labour needs to achieve these not merely out of intellectual considerations of morality or economic efficiency, but because of the brute power politics of needing a client base beyond the media and a few rich donors.

The basic features ought to be obvious: employment and decent housing for all, lots of leisure time and paid holidays, universal healthcare generous maternity provision, inclusion for people with disabilities, free education and universal childcare, freedom to form a relationship and maybe a family with the person of your choice (straight or gay), a woman’s right to choose, tolerance of everyone regardless of faith or race, political freedom and democratic elections under fair conditions, concern for the natural environment and so on. A vision of prosperity for all, even if some degree of inequality might be tolerated to provide incentives and so forth. This wasn’t particularly an ideal limited to the left (in fact parts of the left would have rejected it for something more robustly socialist) but could have been embraced, in its rough outlines, by everyone from the centre-left to people on the centre right... Nobody currently thinks our future looks like Universal Scandinavia – and even in places where social democratic parties are in power, such as the UK – nobody thinks that they will advance even the tiniest step towards it. Rather, the likelihood is that even they will retreat. ""Nice idea, but unaffordable."" Meanwhile, we are being treated to endless homilies from the pundits about how Europe is being ""left behind"" by a dynamic United States. We are sclerotic, hidebound, unproductive and lazy. There is hardly a column by Janan Ganesh in the Financial Times that doesn’t rehearse such points, but there are official reports too, such as a recent one by Mario Draghi (https://commission.europa.eu/topics/strengthening-european-competitiveness/eu-competitiveness-looking-ahead_en) about the need to boost Europe’s competitiveness. Draghi is writing about the EU, of course, but what he says should be taken to apply, mutatis mutandis to all the other places that might once have aspired to Universal Scandinavia. The rhetoric of being ""left behind"", though, the tacit appeal to progress and to a direction of travel, raises the quest of where that travel is to, particularly in the context of a United States that is abandoning democratic norms, where the judiciary is politicized, where women are being deprived of the right to choose, where migrants are being deported en masse, where fascist mobs are pardoned by the President, where opponents are threatened with state persecution, and where a new oligarchy has both acquiesced to and encouraged a fresh authoritarianism. And of course this comes on top of much longer-standing horrors in the US such as crippling health care costs, tyranny on the workplace, miniscule leisure and vacation time, a racist carceral system, frequent mass killings with guns, chlorine-washed chicken, corn-syrup in everything, widespread nostalgia for white supremacy, to begin a long list. Make your own, I don’t have space here. The progress we are in danger of missing out on if we don’t pull up our socks is supposed to be towards growth and prosperity. If we don’t abandon the few anticipatory relics of Universal Scandinavia that remain, we will fall further behind. We need to do this for the money and for the relative position of our states in some global race. Except that, as in the case of the United States itself, the people being asked to tighten their belts now, to accept longer hours, shorter holidays, worse health care, reduced food and environmental standards, are not, on the whole, the ones who will get to see the money. GDP per capita might rise, but since that’s an average measure it is entirely compatible with all the benefits being harvested by the diminishing numbers of the highly advantaged, Meanwhile the professional middle class becomes proletarianized, even as its members are mocked as the ""elites"". What of those other aspects of Universal Scandinavia: the possibility of political community, the availability of art and culture, education and literacy, access to nature, opportunities to travel and the ending of artificial barriers between people, and the rights people enjoy as humans or as citizens? In fact all the goods that aren’t easily assimilable to an increase in per capita wealth and income. One thing that has happened is that systems and institutions that are key components of a functioning social system have ceased to be considered as such. Either they have been reconfigured on the model of for-profit enterprises and expected to survive by generating their own revenue (e.g. universities) or they have been starved of funding in the interests of ""efficiency"" with short-term cost-reduction being very much in the minds of policy-makers but the cost of the long-term consequences — probably falling on someone else’s budget — not so much. The human beings who run most public services have often compensated for fiscal neglect by working harder and self-exploiting out of a sense of professional committment. But that has diminished over time as people feel like suckers, especially when treated as punchbags by politicians and derided by right-wing pundits. And while the state can often count on the professional dedication of people who were recruited and trained when there was a proper service they were serving, those people are ageing, retiring, quitting. Attracting smart and competent new people to work in education, criminal justice, social work and so forth is a different matter. As for the rights our societies used to value for human being or for citizens well, many of those have been thrown away in Europe’s attempt to seal itself off from outsiders. (Universal human rights are inconvenient when the population has come to be hostile to people who might invoke them.) But relatedly, I think there’s also a sense in which the key values that define the non-economic aspects of Universal Scandinavia have been hived off by politicians into the accountability sink of human rights law... There’s similarly a vast difference between certifying that a building meets official safety standards and working to ensure a building is actually safe. My point here isn’t the argue for the full attainability of Universal Scandinavia. Indeed, I’m not unaware of the material, demographic, environmental and other constraints that we face, nor of the extent to which historic European prosperity rests upon the exploitation of others, past and present. It is rather that the very meaning of ""progress"" has been stripped of its, er, ""progressive"" content and reduced to growth in national wealth, income and power. British and European leaders are increasingly abandoning any positive vision of a functioning social system to which they aspire and which realizes human values and secures vital rights and freedoms. Even as the US regresses into barbarism and abandons all pretence at liberal ideals, it is rhetorically saluted as the future that risks leaving ""us"" behind. @ [email protected] (https://mastodon.social/@interfluidity@zirk.us/113912178200989207) : ""Guys, really.

Comrades: A Revolutionary RPG,https://rollingboxcars.com/2021/01/14/how-we-used-to-fight-a-review-of-comrades-a-revolutionary-rpg/,https://www.metafilter.com/207665/Comrades-A-Revolutionary-RPG,Lemkin,https://www.metafilter.com/user/342988,2025-02-14,6,""" Comrades: A Revolutionary RPG (https://rollingboxcars.com/2021/01/14/how-we-used-to-fight-a-review-of-comrades-a-revolutionary-rpg/) is about participating in a fictional revolution. Influenced by real-world events, past and present, players are members of a fledgling underground movement that aims to rise up against a corrupt government, forced to plan, work, and fight from the shadows. Can they do what is necessary when the cause requires it to free the people? Like the past’s real-world revolutions, none are clearly defined, bloodless, or victimless, and neither is Comrades: A Revolutionary RPG."" HerraS (https://writeups.letsyouandhimfight.com/herras/comrades-a-revolutionary-rpg/) : Comrades is inspired by the left-wing revolutionaries and resistance movements of the 20th century. Events like the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, the Prague Spring of ’68 and the fall of the Berlin Wall, where people were willing to fight and die for something they believed in against a corrupt and reactionary government. Movies like Z and The Battle of Algiers , books like Homage to Catalonia and Ten Days that Shook the World . But most importantly it was inspired by the world of today. Seamus Conneely (https://cannibalhalflinggaming.com/2019/03/05/the-independents-comrades-a-revolutionary-rpg/) : Historically speaking revolutions of any kind, and the ones on the left certainly aren’t exempt, are messy affairs as likely to turn on themselves or make things worse as to succeed or simply fail. I’ll admit, I was concerned before reading over how Comrades would address that fact, and was pleasantly surprised at how honest it was with itself. Especially in the Pathways to Revolution: Force points out how the use of violence can spiral into tyranny, Zealotry can spin out of control, and Mayhem is a disaster just waiting to happen. Gita Jackson (https://kotaku.com/socialist-tabletop-game-reminded-me-that-you-have-to-st-1832463653) : No matter how much some of the characters personally disliked each other—and some of them did not like each other very much at all—we all knew that we were here to fight for a better world. Personal disagreements could be hashed out later. Right now, we needed to escape the cops and live to fight another day. Comrades’ system really emphasizes the communal nature of leftist activism. At the end of a session, players vote on which of them had best embodied the revolutionary spirit, and that character then rolls to see whether or not the revolution as a whole advances because of the group’s actions. For us, we decided the moment Natasha kept the front line together, linking their arms against the cops charging at them, was the truest to the spirit of our cause. No matter the foibles that followed, that image of strength and unity in the face of adversity was the one we wanted to remember.","['https://rollingboxcars.com/2021/01/14/how-we-used-to-fight-a-review-of-comrades-a-revolutionary-rpg/', 'https://writeups.letsyouandhimfight.com/herras/comrades-a-revolutionary-rpg/', 'https://cannibalhalflinggaming.com/2019/03/05/the-independents-comrades-a-revolutionary-rpg/', 'https://kotaku.com/socialist-tabletop-game-reminded-me-that-you-have-to-st-1832463653']",metafilter

Before then, the relationship was primarily seen as one of inspiration. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke in these terms in a sermon delivered after his return from the independence ceremonies in Ghana in 1957. The anticolonial movement there, in his estimation, served as an example from which Black Americans might draw strategic lessons and philosophical reinforcement in their parallel, but conceptually distinct, struggle for freedom. By the middle of the 1960s, however, an increasing number of Black intellectuals—including, if only on occasion, King himself—began to describe American racism as a kind of colonialism. from The Lexicon of Empire (https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/the-lexicon-of-empire/) [Boston Review] posted by chavenet (https://www.metafilter.com/user/96486) (4 comments total) 13 users marked this as a favorite (https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/1/207401)","['https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/the-lexicon-of-empire/', 'https://www.metafilter.com/user/96486', 'https://www.metafilter.com/favorited/1/207401']",metafilter

We're getting the social media crisis wrong (https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/were-getting-the-social-media-crisis) - ""The bigger problem isn't disinformation. It's degraded democratic publics."" The fundamental problem is this: we tend to think about democracy as a phenomenon that depends on the knowledge and capacities of individual citizens, even though, like markets and bureaucracies, it is a profoundly collective enterprise. That in turn leads us to focus on how social media shapes individual knowledge, for better or worse, and to mistake symptoms for causes. A lot of argument about democracy - both in public and among the academics who inquire into it - makes heroic claims about the wisdom and intelligence of individual citizens. We want citizens who are wise, well informed and willing to think about the collective good. Sometimes, we even believe that citizens are all these things. The problem is that actual individual citizens are biased and, on average, not particularly knowledgeable about politics. This mismatch between rhetoric and reality has created opportunities for a minor academic industry of libertarians and conservatives arguing that democracy is unworkable and that we should rely instead on well informed elites to rule. The problem with this elitist case against democracy is that elites are just as biased, and furthermore are liable to use their greater knowledge to bolster their biases rather than correct them (for the extended version of this riposte, see this essay (https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/68/the-new-libertarian-elitists/) by Hugo Mercier, Melissa Schwartzberg and myself). The problem of human bias goes all the way down. So what can we do to ameliorate this problem? Making individuals better at thinking and seeing the blind spots in their own individual reasoning will only go so far. What we need are better collective means of thinking. As Hugo, Melissa and I argue here (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/analytical-democratic-theory-a-microfoundational-approach/739A9A928A99A47994E4585059B03398) (academic article, but I think fairly readable), much of the work on human cognitive bias suggests that people can actually think much better collectively than individually, offering prospects for a different understanding of democracy, in which my pig-headed advocacy for my particular flawed perspective allows me to see the flaws in your pig-headed arguments and point them out with gusto, and vice versa, for the general improvement of our thought. This is a particular version of an argument that is made more generally by Herbert Simon. There are sharp limits to individual human cognition, but we have invented collective means to think better together. Brad DeLong has a nice phrase (https://braddelong.substack.com/p/what-the-east-african-plains-ape) for the specific advantage of the human species - “anthology intelligence” - which captures this. Markets, bureaucracies, and indeed democracy can all serve as collective means of problem solving and compensation for individual deficiencies, under the right circumstances. But the qualifying phrase, ‘under the right circumstances,’ is key. All of these institutional forms have failure modes. To understand the particular success and failure modes of democracy, it is better not to focus on individual citizens, but on democratic publics. Democracy is supposed to be a system in which political decisions are taken not by kings, or dictators, but by the public, or by representative agents that are responsible to the public and can be removed through elections or similar. In principle, then, the public is the aggregated beliefs and wants of the citizenry as a whole. The problem is that we have no way to directly see what all the citizens want and believe, or to make full sense of it. So instead we rely on a variety of representative technologies to make the public visible, in more or less imperfect ways. Voting is one such technology - and different voting systems tend to lead to quite different manifestations of the public. “First past the post” systems like the U.S. and United Kingdom tend to produce publics in which political contention is channeled through competition between two opposed parties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) , as opposed to many smaller parties. Opinion polls are another. They now seem quite natural to us as a gauge of public opinion, but as Andy Perrin and Katherine McFarland argue (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1886852) , they seemed strange and unnatural when they were first introduced. More importantly, all these systems are not just passive measures of public opinion but active forces that rework it. As Perrin and McFarland say, “Publics are evoked, even shaped, by [the] techniques that represent them.” Human beings are coalitional animals. We appear to have specialized subsystems in our brain (https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300248548/minds-make-societies/) for understanding what the group politics are in a given situation; who is opposed to who, and what the opportunities are... Again: none of this is brainwashing, but it is reshaping public debate, not just in the US, but in the UK, Europe and other places too. People’s sense of the contours of politics - what is legitimate and what is out of bounds; what others think and are likely to do and how they ought respond - is visibly changing around us. That poses some immediate questions. Can democracy work, if a couple of highly atypical men exercise effective control over large swathes of the public space? How can that control be limited or counteracted, even in principle? What practical steps for reform are available in a democracy shaped by the people who you want to reform out of power? It poses some more general questions too. If you want to work towards a better system of democracy, which is both more stable and more actually responsive to what people want and need, how do you do this? It is easy (I think personally, but I am biased too) to see what is wrong with the public at X/Twitter. It is harder to think clearly about what a healthy public would look like, let alone how to build one. Association and ⿻ Publics (https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/) - ""Therefore, in this chapter, we will outline a theory of the informational requirements for association."" To the extent parks and squares are the site of protest and collective action, we might well search for a digital public square, a function many platforms (https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-twitter-town-square/) have purported to serve. [14] (https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/#fn14) Sites on the original World Wide Web offered unprecedented opportunities for a range of people to make their messages available. But as Economics Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon famously observed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) , this deluge of information created a paucity of attention. [15] (https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/#fn15) Soon it became hard to know if, who and how one was reaching an audience with a website and proprietary search systems like Google. Proprietary social networks like Facebook and Twitter became the platforms of choice for digital communication, but only partly addressed the issue as they had limited (and usually pay-for) affordances for understanding audiences. The digital public square had become a private concession, with the CEO of these companies proudly declaring themselves the public utility (https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/15/facebook-is-a-utility-utilities-get-regulated.html) or public square of the digital age while surveilling and monetizing user interactions through targeted advertising. [16] (https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/#fn16) [...] Luckily, in recent years some of the leaders in open standards technologies of both privacy and publicity have turned their attention to this problem. Lemmer Webber, of ActivityPub fame, has spent the last few years working on Spritely (https://spritelyproject.org) , a project to create self-governing and strongly connected private communities in the spirit of ⿻ publics, allowing individual users to clearly discern, navigate and separate community contexts in open standards. A growing group of researchers in the Web3 and blockchain communities are working on combining these with privacy technologies, especially ZKPs. [27] (https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/#fn27) [...] In 1995, one of De Tocqueville's most prominent heirs, political scientist Robert Putnam, began documenting the decline of American civic life starting in the 1960s in his essay "" Bowling Alone (https://bowlingalone.com/) "". He attributes this to a corresponding reduction in participatory community associations such as fraternal organizations, religious groups and parent teacher associations, leading to his quip that there are more people bowling and fewer bowling leagues. He argues that the decrease in associative behavior directly affects the development of social capital and trust which ""facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit."" [28] (https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/#fn28) Putnam addresses several possible reasons but focuses in particular on television and the ""privatizing"" of our leisure time, noting that ""television has made our communities ... wider and shallower."" His essay preceded the modern Internet but we might import into his argument a phrase from our contemporary digital lives: there's an app for that. A challenge then for the extraordinary reach of 21st century digital technology is the harnessing of that power to form meaningful communities and deeper social interactions. Strong community engagement also cultivates robust civic discourse where social and political problems can be hashed out by constituent citizens.

Nation-state democracies are, to varying degrees, beset by gridlock and hyper-partisanship, little accountability to the popular will, inefficiency, flagging state capacity, inability to keep up with emerging technologies, and corporate capture.""[ 9 (https://www.metafilter.com/196976/Civilization-reboot-Imagine-post-capitalism-instead-of-the-worlds-end) , 10 (https://www.metafilter.com/195711/The-Sunflower-Movements-Useful-Fictions-and-Consensus-Reality) ] Imagine a world of abundant public goods, funded via consortium-based taxes coupled with active participation in investment based on shared need. Right now, many projects with incredible social-value returns, from transportation infrastructure to small businesses that would benefit many in a community, can languish in an innovation valley of death because they’re not well set up for pure public funding, and yet are misaligned with the incentives of private capital. CI mechanisms for pooled funding could address this gap, redirecting state and philanthropic resources into financially supporting these projects in proportion to their deemed benefit to a given community, and dynamically reallocating when necessary. This could better direct scientific and research funding, creating massive positive externalities not well incentivized in the current system, or direct public funding for industrial policy (instead of direct subsidies, which can miss necessary local information or be prone to capture and cronyism). Or imagine a world of CI-enabled firms prioritizing collective provision at scale through effective economic democracy. Advanced CI mechanisms could expand collective input and ownership beyond voice in a single workplace, or a vote every four years. Imagine networks of production run with input from local and global stakeholders, using transaction fees as taxlike sources of funding for long-term investment—radically updating the regulated monopoly. Or AI assistants helping communities navigate value trade-offs, scaling up commons-based governance practices while computing a range of quantitative and qualitative measures to optimize—instead of just maximizing share price. Or platforms that enable individuals and communities to track the effects of new technologies, internalizing externalities from environmental degradation to pandemic risk. Of course, getting there won’t be easy—changing power structures never is. Scholars from John Dewey to Helene Landemore have emphasized the material changes and conditions of “education and freedom”—from access to basic necessities to economic security—needed for democracies to truly enable collective intelligence. Incentive-alignment work, political shifts, base-building, and public advocacy are essential for conveying the urgency of shifting transformative technology toward collective intelligence and input.

I hug trolls. You know some people hug trees, I hug trolls. So people sometimes make personal attacks to me online. Maybe they write 300 words, very vicious, very toxic.

I reply to them with humor. And so I think this idea, which was generalized into something called 'humor over rumor', is to understand that humor in these contexts travels faster than outrage, probably the only emotion that travels faster than outrage, and all these polarization attacks dissipate if you laugh about it – if the tension is left out, right, of the conversation."" -- Audrey Tang (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtW6c8tOYMw#t=40m16s)","['http://bactra.org/weblog/inherent-distortion.html', 'https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/24/i-was-a-multimillionaire-i-had-a-beautiful-girlfriend-i-was-unhappy-the-ups-and-downs-of-a-supertrader', 'https://www.metafilter.com/207337/Ontario-Premier-Doug-Ford-announces-snap-election#8677973', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPoXOwiEfrQ', 'https://archive.is/z6r0x', 'https://archive.is/ow0gZ', 'https://apnews.com/article/trump-inspectors-general-fired-congress-unlawful-4e8bc57e132c3f9a7f1c2a3754359993', 'https://apnews.com/article/colombia-immigration-deportation-flights-petro-trump-us-67870e41556c5d8791d22ec6767049fd', 'https://archive.is/G82uq', 'https://unherd.com/2025/01/welcome-to-americas-techno-military-future/', 'https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/were-getting-the-social-media-crisis', 'https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/68/the-new-libertarian-elitists/', 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/analytical-democratic-theory-a-microfoundational-approach/739A9A928A99A47994E4585059B03398', 'https://braddelong.substack.com/p/what-the-east-african-plains-ape', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law', 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1886852', 'https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300248548/minds-make-societies/', 'https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/', 'https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-twitter-town-square/', 'https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/#fn14', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy', 'https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/#fn15', 'https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/15/facebook-is-a-utility-utilities-get-regulated.html', 'https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/#fn16', 'https://spritelyproject.org', 'https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/#fn27', 'https://bowlingalone.com/', 'https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/#fn28', 'https://www.cip.org/whitepaper#introducing', 'https://www.metafilter.com/201732/Power-Plough-Sword-and-Book-and-Progress-Exit-Voice-and-Loyalty', 'https://www.metafilter.com/206340/Theres-no-such-thing-as-a-person-who-survives-alone#8651795', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtW6c8tOYMw#t=5m38s', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKaGZqqQGCg', 'https://www.metafilter.com/207306/The-Pushback-Thread#8677163', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2TVlhOD2pw', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LscTx6DHh9I', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC7_2AsUbww', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20220814110457/https://www.wired.com/story/collective-intelligence-democracy/', 'https://www.metafilter.com/196976/Civilization-reboot-Imagine-post-capitalism-instead-of-the-worlds-end', 'https://www.metafilter.com/195711/The-Sunflower-Movements-Useful-Fictions-and-Consensus-Reality', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVlBmdvIC6s', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@damileearch/video/7299592141762776326', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Ng5ZvrDm4', 'https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64364', 'https://archive.is/0O4qk', 'https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/12/generative-ai-the-power-and-the-glory/', 'https://archive.is/7Jjj7', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-01-24/vienna-bets-on-heat-pumps-to-decouple-it-from-russian-gas', 'https://archive.is/tIicX', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMx5ajcWnMU', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtW6c8tOYMw#t=40m16s']",metafilter
