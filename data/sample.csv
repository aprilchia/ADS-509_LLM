A: They were planning on buying or associating with a girl in -- in France for a --- company. They were planning to do a company. ***And actually, I gave the paper to Mr Shawn Connolly which is an actual paper that came from the office from Jeffrey Epstein, that was giving instruction to Jean-Luc saying that he wanted to have the same contracts as -- uh, what's his name, of Donald Trump, and that he wanted to have the same kind of benefits for the scouters.***

36256,"&gt;**Trump’s Tie to Whistleblower Report Tulsi Hid in Safe Busted**

&gt;A new report alleges Tulsi Gabbard was informed of a call between a person associated with foreign intelligence and someone close to Donald Trump. The whistleblower complaint that Trump’s spy chief locked away in a safe implicated someone with close ties to the president of having contact with foreign intelligence. \[...\]

&gt;When National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard was informed, she took a paper copy of the memo to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. The day after that meeting, she instructed the NSA to send the highly classified details to her office instead of publishing them, according to the whistleblower’s attorney Andrew P. Bakaj.

&gt;Gabbard was accused of hiding the complaint made against her in a safe. Bakaj, who was briefed on the sensitive phone call, told The Guardian that the whistleblower first contacted the office of the intelligence community inspector general about the burying of the highly classified materials on April 17, 2025. The whistleblower then filed a formal complaint on May 21, 2025. That complaint did not become known to Congress until November. A leaked memo revealed that the complaint accused Gabbard of refusing to share a “highly classified intelligence report” for “political purposes.” \[...\]

&gt;Gabbard claimed in a nearly 600-word X post on Saturday that Johnson did not inform her that the whistleblower wanted to take the complaint to Congress. While she knew about the complaint and confirmed that it was kept in a safe, she denied that she “hid” the information and first saw the complaint two weeks ago. \[...\]

&gt;While Gabbard said she sent guidance to the inspector general, Bakaj, the whistleblower’s attorney, sent a letter to Gabbard on Tuesday stating that his client had not received such direction. \[...\]",reddit
