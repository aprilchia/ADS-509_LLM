"Regarding the composition of the Minnesota legislature: the Senate is closely divided with a slight DFL (Democratic) majority, and the House is divided in an exact tie. DFL and Republicans worked out a power-sharing agreement with some difficulty at the start of the session. The session is now done, and the special session to wrap up budget work just completed, so there's no immediate balance-of-power advantage that would come from an assassination. Theoretically, Republicans will have a one-seat majority for a few weeks, but the DFL will almost certainly retain the seat in a special election, and no work is scheduled to happen in the meantime",metafilter

"So some views on the politics - I try not to pay attention to polling as their value has declined since the 2016 english-speaking-world dramas, but it's hard not to see the Coalition bombing badly after a lackluster campaign predicated on the government losing rather than their winning.  Through 2024 and into early 2025 they looked likely to coast into power as the cost-of-living bit across the country. But being stuck in the global-right-wing bubble does them no favours in Australia, where the compulsory and preferential voting system tends to reward those who tack towards the political centre, and a defined campaign filtered through media forces attention to detail rather than vibes. Trying to draw on Trumpian ideas backfired badly when Australians started to see the chaos of such thinking, and culturally we're a little less keen overall (not to say we don't have our own right-wingers) on engaging in culture wars and punching down on public servants, women, Indigenous Australians, and the like. Meanwhile,  a slow economic turnaround and a fair bit of success in gradual reform across several policy areas saw the Labor government have a story to tell that made them seem re-electable.  Australians are fairly aware of the world, and seemed to recognise that the cost of living crisis was not something that the Australian Government could uniquely be blamed for or solve. Broadly, the Green, teal and independent members elected in 2022 have been successful in ensuring their profile, even if they haven't been in government.  Some are the most trusted and highly visible politicians in the country, and many have shown a strong sense of the pulse of their communities and a high quality non-ideological commitment to integrity and good policy. The big question is the eventual makeup of the Parliament.  Polls don't help us because the decline of the two party system means many many seats are in play with multiple possible outcomes. My hope is for an emboldened progressive Labor government - either with a workable majority and a PM thinking about legacy;  or a minority Labor government that's pushed and agile enough to be more true to its traditional progressive values and less nervous about Australia's big-business rent-seekers.  In the case of the former - Albo started off as a traditional leftie, and I'd hope he can add to his general incrementalism delivering something really important.  In the case of the latter,  a minority Labor government has recent experience in working with a smaller cross-bench from the 2010-13 Gillard government and can own the stuff that works while blaming the cross-bench for anything that goes wrong",metafilter

"While I'm against subsidies I think there's a few reasons. 

First, building the stadium and bringing the team(s) in generates income, sales and property tax revenue from all the jobs. Not just the players but all the support staff and third party businesses in the stadium. 

Second, without a subsidy they would obviously need to raise ticket prices. This would have a negative effect on attendance and by extension tax revenue.

Third, by appearing to be a tax friendly city/municipality/state they can encourage more people to setup shop having a net benefit on revenues.

These are important because unlike the Federal Government lesser governments (city/state/county) do not have access to a printing press. 

Now as always does the projected revenue generated actually surpass the subsidy? Because if it doesn't then it's not worth it.",reddit

"Guess which country colonised India? Yeah, it was Britain. Guess what language the British speaks. No, it is not Mandarin, it's English. But guess why?!<p>Google for &quot;Macaulay Doctrine&quot; to understand how the colonial British brutally enforced English as the primary language in Indian schools, with evil intention to erode and destroy ancient Indian education system (Gurukul system) and learning traditions (including outlawing the learning of classical martial arts, banning the teaching of Hindu/Sanatani scriptures in Indian schools, banning classical Indian music &amp; arts in schools, etc.).<p>But thankfully, after India for Independence after centuries of oppression and enslavement/subjugation by Mughal and British, it is ironical that English is not mandatory in Indian schools, and there is stil significant population (hundreds of millions of citizens, especially in rural areas) of India who don't know English (but they know their native language as they learnt it in school as a primary language).<p>So what China has done in Tibet, Nepal and other lands it has seized, is similar to the evil colonial Macaulay Doctrine, by enforcing Mandarin as a mandatory language in schools, with the evil intent to destroy the traditional language, history, culture.<p>But Chinese government (CCP) didn't start such native culture destruction in other lands first. It did it in China first. CCP destroyed thousands of classical literature, Chinese Buddhist sacred texts and other traditional knowledge repositories, with the singular evil aim to enforce its own mutated corrupted version of Chinese Buddhism across China. That's why CCP tried to arrest &amp; assassinate the Tibetan religious leader (His Holiness The Dalai Lama; but he managed to escape to India in the nick of time when China invaded and seized Tibet, and he's been living  and teaching peacefully in India since then) and when it failed to do so, the CCP brought in its own fake Dalai Lama to confuse and mislead the subjugated Tibetan population.<p>But this is modern era and Age of Information, so all such evil tactics and corruption of history and culture are getting exposed. World knows what evils China is up to, especially in Asia and Africa.",Hacker News

"It feels a bit like he's cramming the reality of global collapse into his preconceived narrative of financial inequality. There's no question that the two are related, but I don't think they're synonymous. It's easy to imagine an egalitarian society in which everyone equally overconsumes and trashes the planet. Conversely, in theory anyway, there could be a society in which people's resources are wildly unequal but there is a consensus that the context of wild nature must be preserved. In the world we currently live in, many millions of people materially benefit from the system that they condemn. We live in the physical comfort, luxury even, that is provided by fossil fuels, mining, global trade, etc., while condemning those very things and desiring a world that we've never lived in. I agree that the rich and powerful are the most destructive and the most to blame for our current predicament, that seems to me to be beyond argument. But the belief that we could escape the coming disaster solely by equalizing the gap between rich and poor is naive. We live in a world of eight billion + human beings, the vast majority of whom exist only because of fossil fuels (nitrogen fertilizer) and the medicalization that has allowed so many to survive. None of this is sustainable. The problem goes far deeper than financial inequality",metafilter
